In a world where the majority of new jobs require science, technology and math skills, it is time our Liberal Arts majors get IT (Information Technology)! While employers recognize and value the importance of liberal education and the liberal arts, they also want liberal arts graduates who are not digitally challenged. Many employers report a “skills gap” as they have trouble finding recent graduates qualified with ample digital skills to fill various positions. Meanwhile, a national educational movement in computer coding instruction is growing at lightning speeds in schools across the US and many consider coding more like a basic life skill (which might someday lead to a great job) rather than an extracurricular activity. App Inventor (AI) serves to narrow this skills gap and increase the versatility of students to become active creators of technology and “digitally” ready for the workplace rather than just being passive consumers of technology. Sales of hand-held devices (smartphones, tablets and phablets) are exploding. These on-line, social, and increasingly mobile computing devices are ubiquitous and offer visual, tactile and personal experiences as never before.

Enriched OER content (text, video, simulations, etc.) orients students to the shifting business landscape and prepares them for success in business program curriculum and the workplace.This course was written by Linda Williams of Tidewater Community College and Lumen Learning and is supplemented by content from OpenStax Principles of Economics, Boundless Business, and videos from multiple sources.-----------------------------Review------------------------------------------------------------------Our CriteriaAccuracy and CurrencyHow accurate is the material, based on current standards in the field?If the material is inaccurate, does it acknowledge conflicts in perspectives and changes over time?If the material is outdated, does it serve other purposes (to provide historical perspective, to provoke discussion, or to serve as an example)?Within this review of Lumen\\'s Open Educational Resource (OER) Introduction to Business by Linda Williams, I chose to pick one part of the course content to review - Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR). The material is based on current standards within the business ethics foundation. This portion of CSR goes over current terminology such as \"green-washing\" and connects to current controversies within CSR, which is important to students going forward in business. Thus far, I see that this information serves discussion purposes, as well as historical relevance. The chapter starts with President Calvin Coolidge\\'s vantage to of business not being a part of business, outside of people being a foundation to business.BiasHow does the material acknowledge perspectives (of the authors, of other experts in the field, of critical voices, etc.)?How does the material present facts, opinions, and judgments?How does the licensing of the material allow the instructor to remix or revise biased content?The material doesn\\'t acknowledge the author\\'s perspective, which doesn\\'t give a bias. It does present facts within the chapter. In my review, I am unsure if educators can revise the content; but, educators can add portions of the course OER to their classrooms, i.e. CANVAS or Blackboard.Ability to Overcome Barriers to EngagementHow does the material engage students? Does the material reflect student experience and views?How do students access the material? Does it require technology skills? Can it be accessed in multiple ways through multiple means?How does the material/resource respond to accommodative and adaptive technologies?In reviewing the CSR chapter, I was happy to see video supporting \"Increased Pressure from Consumers\" subsection of the chapter. This could be a great reflection of students views.  This material does require technology skills in order for access to this chapter and OER book. In my review, I was able to connect to the OER course and chapter through a desktop computer, but I did not connect via a mobile phone. For accessibility (ADA) purposes, it is possible to use \"talk to text\" or \"speechnotes\" with this OER.Publishing Process & LicensingHow was the material published? What kind of review/editing process was used?How is the material licensed and stored? Can it be remixed and revised as needed? Is it subscription-based and if so, who pays for the subscription?What is the \\'permanence\\' of this material? Is it temporal (likely to be removed or taken down)? What would be the back-up plan if license/access to this material is lost?Depending if the educator uses \"Waymaker\", \"OHM\", or \"Candela\", each student could pay between $10 to $25 per student as a subscription, in comparison to over $100 for a textbook. Lumen offer workshops and training within their OER program.Relevant to Course & InstitutionHow does this material align with course objectives and learning activities?At the beginning of the CSR chapter,  it gives student outcomes such has the definition of CSR, describe the impact of CSR to its stakeholders, and give examples to students of what CSR is within business. This material is align to \"Introduction to Business\" student outcomes, as well as to AACSB International accreditation.Relevant to StudentsHow does the material reflect student interests and learning goals?How does the material give student autonomy in their learning?How does the material encourage interaction, critical thinking, and deeper learning/processing',\n","       \"The Health IT Workforce Curriculum was developed for U.S. community colleges to enhance workforce training programmes in health information technology.

These two MIT Museum speakers hope you\\'ll walk away from their talk with a good case of augmentation envy – or at least a healthy respect for what technology can do for the human body and soul. John Hockenberry has used a wheelchair for 30 years, since a car accident left him a paraplegic. He tells us the public has viewed spinal cord injuries like his as \"something horrific,\" or \"staggeringly poignant.\" But in the last 10 years, disability has moved from being \"an extraordinarily fringe activity\" to a central issue facing society, that of \"marrying technology with humanity in a way that is organic to the body, appropriate to the spirit and sustainable to the community.\" Hockenberry believes that the needs and demands of disabled people are helping push science toward creating a set of design principles \"that will allow this issue of human restoration and augmentation to merge into a kind of seamless unity.\" In illustration of this claim, Hugh Herr describes the astonishing strides engineers are making in the development of \"Human 2.0.\" He starts with himself -- a victim of frostbite during a 1982 mountain climbing accident. After losing both feet below the knee, Herr headed for the machine shop, and realized he didn\\'t have to accept the version of his body provided by nature. So he cobbled together a pair of prostheses perfect for climbing (which made him over 7 feet tall), followed by other foot-ankle replacements made lightweight and responsive through carbon composite materials and computers. These designs are better than his originals, suggests Herr. \"What\\'s fun about having part of your body artificial is that you can upgrade. It\\'s depressing to me, too bad that you folks have biological limbs.\" Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have fueled the work in Herr\\'s lab. He\\'s now building robotic versions of arms and legs that restore capability, using computers and powered systems with sensors and motors. Stroke victims can use similar models, wrapped around an impaired limb, to restore symmetry between their left and right sides. The big prize will be a neural interface, a way of growing and reactivating an amputated nerve, so that it begins to convey sensory information through the complex networks of the brain. \"The dream here is that one day I and other people with limb amputations will not only be able to walk across a sandy beach but feel the sand against their prosthesis,\" says Herr. Researchers haven\\'t imposed limits on their attempts at augmentation – or improvement. An MIT lab has designed a \"socio-emotional prosthesis,\" Herr tells us – using deep brain stimulators that leave subjects feeling \"happy, calm, content.\" Hockenberry wonders in conclusion whether we are \"blowing away the notion of normal entirely and creating a completely improvisational notion of what it means to be human.\" Herr proposes that in the future, \"when we have many, many types of intimate technologies that are inside and attached to our bodies, it will unleash a renaissance in expression.\"',\n","       'Math.com is a free site where you can choose from any math topic.

The rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the last few years bears witness to this phenomenon. This contribution considers whether MOOCs afford a collaborative environment in which participants can develop the necessary literacy skills to become successful self-directed learners and members of online communities. It also discusses the extent to which self-determination and participatory literacy might be relevant for success in different types of MOOCs. The paper draws on data from OT12, an 8-week MOOC on open translation tools and practices run in 2012 by the Department of Languages of The Open University in the United Kingdom. The data consist of pre- and post-course surveys covering learners' backgrounds and prior experience of translation, expectations and challenges envisaged, and evaluation of outcomes. The authors conclude that to conceive of MOOCs as environments where individuals coalesce around a common endeavor is to raise a series of under-explored challenges. For organizers, the challenge lies in learning design and facilitation, and the extent to which their assumptions about the participants match the learners' capabilities. For learners, the challenge rests in self-determination and participatory literacy skills.\",\n","       'Part 1 of a list of more than 40 (including hyperlinks) associations concerned with aspects of distance learning:  Hyperlinks to each of the organizations in this list: 1)Alberta Association of Courseware Producers 2)Association for Media and Technology in Education in Canada 3) CATA Alliance - Canadian Advanced Technology Association 4) Centre for Research and Innovation 5) Information Technology Association of Canada 6) Interactive Multimedia Arts and Technologies Association 7) Software Human Resource Council 8) Association for Applied Interactive Multimedia 9) Association for Educational Communications and Technology 10) Association for the Advancement of Computing Education (AACE) 11) Computer Game Developers Association 12)DigitalLearning.Org 13) Educause 14) Electronic Industries Association 15) Institute for Academic Technology 16) Institute for the Transfer of Technology to Education (ITTE) 17) Instructional Systems Association (ASA) 18) Multimedia Development Group 19) MultiMedia Telecom Assoc. 20) SIGCAT Foundation (Special Interest Group on CD Applications & Technology)',\n","       'This video was recorded at Multilingual Information Access Technology Transfer Day 2009.

He claims that after losing billions of dollars, the pharmaceutical industry and academia are beginning to see the value in testing drugs by measuring outcomes in biological networks. He calls this systems pharmacology, where you \"measure in living systems multiple analytes in the same organism, perturbing the state and taking thousands of measurements per sample.\" Researchers use computer images to visualize the differences and similarities in drug response across many networks, and then try to correlate these responses statistically. The inability to predict toxicity early in drug development cost the pharmaceutical industry an astonishing $8 billion in 2003, says Joseph Bonventre, approximately one-third the cost of all drug failures. \"We generally can\\'t pick up toxicity until it\\'s too late,\" he says, so key challenges are developing better preclinical studies with useful biomarkers, improved animal models, and high throughput techniques; and on the clinical side, coming up with a \"safe harbor approach to amass kidney and other toxicity data,\" developing consortia to validate biomarkers, dealing with IP issues and building \"an improved bedside to bench flow of information.\" Linda Griffith\\'s vision is \"building a human body on a chip.\" She\\'s not talking about an individual\\'s genome or health history, but \"a living, 3D interconnected set of tissues on a chip. If you perturb it, you make it develop a disease.\" Such a device would enable researchers to predict negative drug interactions and even to build models of disease. Griffiths\\' version of liver tissue, built on a silicon scaffold, may prove especially useful for drug toxicity tests. At Biogen, \"the holy grail for any justification of a new approach or technology is that we\\'re going to chop a significant amount off the time it takes to move a new product from bench to bedside,\" says James Green. He believes that \"drugs and paradigms are orders of magnitude more complicated than 24 years ago.\" He hopes that new techniques \"that take us into the genome, interpreting data as patterns\" offer some promise.',\n","       'This online textbook addresses the population of individuals with disabilities that experience complex lifelong needs across multiple areas in their lives.

Recent development in information and communication technology has enabled to study networks of social interactions of unprecedented size. Such systems include email or phone networks and e-communities. In contrast to the traditional, questionnaire-based investigations, in these cases a natural quantitative measure of the strength of the interactions is present (like the frequency or duration of calls) leading to weighted network representations. One important observation is that this strength of the interactions varies over many orders of magnitude. A natural conclusion is that the weights play important roles both in the evolution of the networks and in the dynamics of the processes on them. Based on simple rules borrowed from sociology we construct a model, where the emergence of the community structure is a consequence of the interplay between topology and weights. We show that the model reflects well the observations made on a huge call network. References: [1] J.M. Kumpula, J.-P. Onnela, J. Saramäki, K. Kaski, J.

The mood of gloom has eased somewhat within the science community, with the advent of a new presidential administration, and Marc Kastner captures the mix of hopefulness and trepidation among his peers around the enormous challenges the nation faces in coming years. Kastner describes four areas \"in order of increasing difficulty\" the new president must address: The president\\'s first move should be to increase the prestige of science in government, by giving the science advisor a more important role, listening carefully to career scientists in government agencies, and encouraging rather than punishing them for speaking out. Second, Kastner advises expanding basic research on energy and environment. The U.S. imports $700 billion worth of oil per year, placing the nation \"in jeopardy economically and politically,\" says Kastner. Clean energy is likely to be a huge industry, and if the U.S. is to lead worldwide, it must begin to master a cluster of technologies that together pose our best chance of beating climate change. We need a huge infusion of R&D money in such thorny areas as: carbon sequestration (we don\\'t yet know if CO2 can be efficiently and safely injected into underground pore space); electrical storage, where we need a five-fold improvement in battery technology to produce an all-electric car that can run for 200 miles; solar energy, where current solar cells are made from materials that are too costly, and not yet efficient enough. While federal and private energy research has been declining, the International Energy Agency estimates the world will require $17 trillion dollars to stabilize CO2emissions between now and 2050. The third order of business involves biology: Having teased apart the DNA molecule and mapped the genome, we now stand ready for a third revolution in life science, says Kastner. This will involve the convergence of biology with mathematics, physics and engineering. Says Kastner: \"The gigantic amount of data being generated by rapid sequencing requires new approaches: biology needs theory for the first time, needs integrating ideas to explore information and come up with clarity.\" The final and perhaps toughest job involves stabilizing science funding. Over the past 20 years, math, physical science and engineering funding have remained flat. In the life sciences it doubled (partly due to 9/11), then declined. While \"it\\'s wonderful to give more money to science,\" rapid increases over short times have often been followed by sharp dips, creating major research disruptions. Plus, says Kastner, it\\'s unhealthy to fund one area and not the rest. \"Different sciences reinforce each other and the scientific enterprise cannot do well if only one field is supported and the others are not.\"',\n","       'The ATETV project delivers web-based videos to connect students to careers in advanced technology.

Cellphone and mobile communication aficionados (not to mention the rest of us) appreciate that our favorite tech gadgets increasingly resemble props from Star Trek. A shout out then to Irwin Jacobs and Qualcomm, the company perhaps most responsible for such astonishing gear. In his talk, Jacobs narrates his journey from MIT, as a faculty member in the early 60s, to California and his initial entrepreneurial venture, Linkabit. Jacobs and other MIT talent applied information theory to projects for NASA and JPL, including coding for deep space probes, and processor designs. Before Jacobs moved on, Linkabit had come up with the idea for satellites that enabled live data communications between headquarters and retail stores for both Wal-Mart and 7-11. The company\\'s designs led to the direct broadcast satellite systems for XM and Direct TV. Its digital scrambling system fed digital technology into TV transmissions. The even bigger story for Jacobs (and the world) involves his next venture, Qualcomm (for Quality Communications), launched in 1985. This fruitful collaboration among MIT and Linkabit graduates launched the wireless telecommunications revolution. Qualcomm first gave the trucking industry OmniTRACS, a satellite-based commercial mobile system, and then dreamed up a technology for wireless and data devices -- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) -- that has revolutionized business and personal communications. Qualcomm made it possible for a multitude of users to share a confined spectrum space, and then for high speed data to fit comfortably alongside voice applications. There are four billion mobile subscribers around the world, says Jacobs, of which 100 million users get voice plus data. Even in these dire economic times, new subscribers are growing, and he predicts six billion subscribers by 2013. Qualcomm\\'s hard at work optimizing how data and voice share transmissions, making new applications possible (and affordable) worldwide. The goal: wireless broadband connectivity for all, and to each his or her own Smartphone or Kindle. As cellphones proliferate and merge with mobile computing, we\\'ll be able to keep tabs on each other via GPS, says Jacobs. He believes phones \"will quickly replace credit cards, even replace money.\" He sees particular opportunities in telemedicine, where phones armed with sensors can transmit patient information to specialists in hospitals, who then zip back treatment recommendations. Jacobs takes pride in Qualcomm\\'s efforts to leverage wireless cellphone tech for social benefits: helping Indonesian women in business ventures; bringing farmers and fishermen a way of determining market prices for their goods without a middle man; and bringing in 3G phones for kids without computer capability in China.',\n","       'Susan Wyckoff is the PI for this project to build a premier site for exchange of Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology Education information.

Among these challenges are the widening Intergenerational Information Technology (IIT) divide and the need for a comprehensive and balanced multidisciplinary training. In the past few years, it has become clear that one significant hurdle impedes the efforts to integrate information technology in the classroom – the Intergenerational IT divide. The IIT gap reflects a different growing misalignment between providers and recipients of the science and technology educational content in terms of the expected vs. supplied, needed vs. perceived and contextual vs. abstract specialized learning. The common K-12 teacher or college instructor is much less familiar with, and slower to adapt to, the new ether of communication and novel IT resources.

In fact, in some places, it\\'s downright hopeful, as Rwandan President Paul Kagame attests. \"Our continent is no longer all about violence and disease and human disasters that scarred many African countries in recent decades,\" says Kagame. \"We are now becoming a continent of opportunities.\" There are those who doubted Rwanda could \"constitute a viable state,\" says Kagame, but 14 years after bloody genocide and civil war, his country has managed an astonishing revival -- enough \"stability and resilience to allow the economy to grow at an average 7% annually in the past several years.\" Other African nations have been expanding at the same pace; oil producers are zooming along at even faster clips. Kagame attributes this recovery to such factors as the \"leapfrogging power of mobile technology,\" where hundreds of millions of new cell phone users, even in remote areas without electricity, drive the growth of new business. And the number of internet subscribers in Africa is growing more than three times as fast as the rest of the world, says Kagame. Cell phones and the internet allow Rwandan and other micro entrepreneurs to develop business networks. Kagame describes how technology helped a Kigali bakery expand beyond its neighborhood to reach more customers and suppliers, enabling workers to move into larger homes. In Kenya, Kagame recounts, a new agricultural commodity exchange \"has reduced barriers between farmers, traders and consumers,\" with the internet and cell phone text messages providing timely market information. This network has improved the incomes of farm families by 25%, leading to better healthcare and education. Rwanda\\'s power utility is also reaping the benefits of technology, keeping track of customers and accounts more efficiently, and no longer relying on government handouts. But while technology has enabled Africans \"to leapfrog some features of underdevelopment,\" Kagame says it is not enough. \"Our vision of becoming a middle income country by 2020 … requires thinking and acting inventively, boldly and creatively.\" Kagame wants to build a foundation not just in technology but in science. Doing this requires a heavy investment in all levels of education. \"Without a knowledge base,\" he says, \"Africa\\'s imperative for agricultural and industrial development to create wealth will remain unrealized.\" He calls for members of the MIT community to join \"in overcoming our challenges and turning them into rewarding opportunities.\"',\n","       'Collection of links to information on gender & sexuality.\\xa0 About the Internet Public Library (from the site):\"The IPL was founded by a class at the University of Michigan’s School of Information, and Michigan SI students almost exclusively generated its content and managed the Ask a Question reference service.

Toward those ends, the following features (beyond an extraordinarily clear book) make this an outstanding text:\\n1- Integrated (Optional) Nike Case Study: A Nike case study is available for instructors who wish to introduce students to business using an exciting and integrated case (updated each semester). Through an in-depth study of a real company, students learn about the functional areas of business and how these areas fit together. Studying a dynamic organization on a real-time basis allows students to discover the challenges that it faces, and exposes them to critical issues affecting the business, such as globalization, ethics and social responsibility, product innovation, diversity, supply chain management, and e-business. Students learn about Nike by reading a case study broken down into 26 individual case notes, each linked to the appropriate section(s) of the text. Each provides a real-world example to help students master a particular topic. We also provide four award-winning videos featuring company executives discussing: the company’s history, its corporate responsibility challenges and initiatives, its commitment to product innovation, and its entrance into the soccer shoe market. Instructors can show the 15-minute videos in class or have students watch them online. Discussion questions written by the author aid classroom discussions on the video topics. Each chapter contains a multi-part question on one of the Nike case notes covered in the chapter. In addition, the test item file contains multiple-choice questions keyed to the Nike cases.\\n2- A Progressive (Optional) Business Plan: Having students develop a business plan in the course introduces students to the excitement and challenges of starting a business and helps them discover how the functional areas of business interact. This textbook package includes an optionalintegrated business plan project modeled after one refined by the author and her teaching team over the past ten years. Students begin by reviewing a document describing the business plan project. In subsequent chapters, students complete another section of the 10-part business plan project. By the end of the course they’re shown how to integrate each individual section into a final plan. Because the project is carefully coordinated with the presentation of course materials, students are able to apply what they’re learning, as they’re learning it, to the practical process of preparing a business plan. Preparing the financial section of the business plan can be difficult for students, so we furnish students with an Excel template that simplifies the process. They don’t even need to be competent in Excel to use it; it’s simple to use and we provide detailed instructions.\\n3- AACSB Emphasis: The text provides end-of-chapter questions, problems, and cases that ask students to do more than regurgitate information. Most require students to gather information, assess a situation, think about it critically, and reach a conclusion. Each chapter presents ten Questions and Problems as well as five cases on areas of skill and knowledge endorsed by AACSB: Learning on the Web, Career Opportunities, The Ethics Angle, Team-Building Skills, and The Global View. More than 70% of end-of-chapter items help students build skills in areas designated as critical by AACSB, including analytical skills, ethical awareness and reasoning abilities, multicultural understanding and globalization, use of information technology, and communications and team oriented skills. Each AACSB inspired exercise is identified by an AACSB tag and a note indicating the relevant skill area.\",\n","       'This class offers a broad coverage of technology concepts and trends underlying current and future developments in information technology, and fundamental principles for the effective use of computer-based information systems.

Ray Kurzweil may be the closest thing we have to a crystal ball. And if anyone has the right to some credibility in the prognostication arena, this overachieving inventor can. With crackling speed, Kurzweil powerpoints through charts illustrating the growth of various technologies over the centuries. His main points: technology evolves exponentially; the rate of technical progress itself is accelerating, so expect to \"see 20,000 years of progress in the 21st century, about 1000 times greater than the 20th century.\" Before you can say, \"Hold your horses,\" Kurzweil is off and running.

These will also enable \"full immersion virtual reality from within nervous systems\" and expand human intelligence, facilitating \"brain to brain communication.

A semantic product memory stores a diary of an individual physical object in a persistent way on an embedded sensor system that is networked by wireless communication to a smart environment. The product monitors itself and its environment. Semantic technologies based on OWL ontologies guarantee interoperability of the product memory across the complete supply chain and lifecycle of smart objects and enable end user access to the product\\'s lifelog. In this talk, we present the layered architecture together with the representation and inference formalisms used in our SemProM project, funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) with 16 Million Euro. SemProM goes well beyond traditional RFID technology and is the basis for intelligent automation in smart factories, event-driven logistics as well as smart retail and after-sales. Collecting information logs about objects in such smart environments and making it available - for example about an object\\'s origin, location, movements, physical properties, environmental conditions, usage history, as well as warranty and maintenance data - can help enterprises to improve their business processes and create new ones. Existing business process models become more accurate since information taken directly from the point of action can be used to manage or adapt processes in real time for the emerging Internet of Things. We show how such embedded \"black box\" event recorders can transform everyday objects like cars, circuit boards, pizzas and drug blister packs into smart products. We show how consumers of smart products can access the lifelogs of products by NFC-enabled smartphones using SemProM\\'s browser and track the complete history of a product in multimodal dialogues.

The Turn automatic targeting network provides advertisers a revolutionary option for online advertising campaigns (online advertising is a $16 billion industry in 2006 according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau). An advertiser simply inputs its ad into a self-serve console, and Turn does the rest. Unlike many ad networks operating today, Turn incorporates extensive industry expertise and innovative technology from the fields of machine learning, information science and statistics, to truly make online advertising risk-free, relevant, simple, effective, and most importantly, profitable. Unlike traditional ad networks where advertisers need teams of employees to manage manual targeting including selecting sites or selecting and optimizing hundreds of thousands of keywords, the Turn network automatically analyzes and targets ads. Turn's technology dynamically selects and blends hundreds of variables such as past performance, brand strength, user profiles, action type and site categories to determine the best targets for each ad, thus eliminating guesswork, time and complexity. The Turn network is based on statistical technology that intelligently targets both text and graphical ads. By dynamically and automatically selecting and blending targeting variables, Turn can determine the best ad or group of ads for any situation. Turn offers true pay-forperformance with its unique bidded CPA model. Because advertisers pay for actions that they define, Turn eliminates the risk of worthless or fraudulent clicks. Whether an advertiser is paying for product purchases, site visits, leads, or email signups, the advertiser is in control of what they pay for and when they pay for it. In the context of this problem setting (with billions of ad impressions), this poster will address some key issues in modeling rare events using machine learning and data mining such as uncertainty, the regression versus classification dilemma and feature engineering.\",\n","       \"IV Handbook is a mobile app developed by McGraw-Hill.\\xa0 There is a $44.99 fee at the time of this review.\\xa0 Information about the app from the website is noted below:\\nAdminister I.V. medications knowledgeably, safely and confidently!

Four million more 18-29 year olds voted in 2008 than in 2004, says Ian Rowe, and nearly 70% of these voted for Obama. Rowe\\'s convinced this enormous leap in voters, and their sharp preference for one candidate, \"is due to the use of new media.\" He credits the Obama campaign\\'s extraordinary mastery of both message and delivery, citing a \"centralized and decentralized process; the idea that everyone had part-ownership of the brand.\" The campaign reached young people via cellphone, Twitter, and Facebook. He notes Obama\\'s website, FighttheSmears.com, which battled scurrilous internet rumors. Users \"became an ally to preserve and protect his brand,\" says Rowe.

This represents \"a new kind of governance about bringing you into the process.\" Marc Ambinder believes that the 2004 and 2008 campaigns were successful because \"they both managed to use tried and tested old media marketing techniques and merge them with technology.\" While lagging in resources and technique four years ago, the Democrats this time round were fueled by Obama\\'s massive $630 million war-chest. The end result was an email database of around 10 million people, which they put to use in social networks like Facebook. Ambinder also recalls a fascinating effort using old and new media in South Carolina, where the Obama campaign worried about gaining votes among older African- American women. Campaign staff recorded some of Michelle Obama\\'s speeches on the subject, and sent volunteers with DVDs and VHS tapes of her talks to beauty parlors. \"Volunteers spent tens of thousands of hours…loosening resistance.\" Then when polls opened, data warehouses on some of these voters allowed campaigners to determine who hadn\\'t yet voted, and target them with phone calls and offers of a ride. GOP technology guru Cyrus Krohn finds the amount of information his party has on voters kind of scary. He describes how third party data mining groups helped the Republican National Committee match information from a voter file with a voter\\'s \"public profile on a social network.\" This proved a \"goldmine\" for targeting purposes. But \"technology is a commodity,\" says Krohn, and \"it\\'s the cachet and persona of a candidate that will drive the use of it.\" Krohn was \"daunted by the amount of user-generated content…in support of Obama.\" The piece of media that created the most buzz around McCain was the video \"McCain Girls,\" which turned out to be the product of the liberal Huffington Post. Such is the impact of technology that Krohn has found himself helping every RNC division think about how to deploy it. Anyone looking for campaign work should be proficient in C++ and Java, recommends Krohn.',\n","       \"This video was recorded at 5th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), Tenerife 2008. The vision of the Semantic Web is to enhance today's Web by exploiting machine-processable metadata. The explicit representation of the semantics of data, enriched with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together a large network of human knowledge and makes this knowledge machine-processable. Various automated services will help the users to achieve their goals by accessing and processing information in machine-understandable form. This network of knowledge systems will ultimately lead to truly intelligent systems, which will be employed for various complex decision-making tasks. Semantic Web research can benefit from ideas and cross-fertilization with many other areas: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Databases and Information Systems, Information Retrieval, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social Networks and Web Engineering. Many advances within these areas can contribute towards the realization of the Semantic Web. The continuing success of ESWC as a premier publication place in the area of semantics has culminated in a record number of high-quality submissions for this year (275 submissions, 19% acceptance rate). The 5th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2008) will present the latest results in research and applications of Semantic Web technologies. ESWC 2008 will also feature a tutorial program, system descriptions and demos, a posters track, a Ph.D. symposium and a number of collocated workshops.

Fueled by these growth rates and the desire to provide added incentives and opportunities for both advertisers and publishers, alternative business models to online advertising are been developed. This tutorial will review the main business models of online advertising including: the pay-per-impression model (CPM); and the pay-per-click model (CPC); a relative new comer, the pay-per-action model (CPA), where an action could be a product purchase, a site visit, a customer lead, or an email signup; and dynamic CPM (dCPM) which optimizes a campaign towards the sites and site sections that perform best for the advertiser. This tutorial will also discuss in detail the technology being leveraged to automatically target ads within these business models; this largely derives from the fields of machine learning (e.g., logistic regression, online learning), statistics (e.g., binomial maximum likelihood), information retrieval (vector space model, BM25), optimization theory (linear and quadratic programming), economics (auction mechanisms, game theory).

Marshall Carter leads an MIT class through a case study on corporate transformation, highlighting tips he believes are as salient for engineering students as for those focused on business services. Don\\'t turn to the best-seller lists for advice on change, advises Carter, since most books pick up the story after a business has made the strategic decision to remake itself. Carter\\'s decade (1991-2001) with Boston\\'s venerable State Street Bank helps illuminate the thinking that comes before the decision, and the steps necessary to fulfill it. State Street, Carter recounts, had focused primarily on processing transactions, such as the purchase or sale of stocks and bonds, only to watch its key products age, and revenues drop. At the same time, \"customers were asking us for more and more information,\" such as the IBM pension manager\\'s request for the geographic distribution of his plan\\'s mutual funds. State Street did not then have a sophisticated enough network to provide such data. So the bank came to realize it needed \"a new vision and operating model.\" Carter and top managers figured out that \"each security purchase or sales threw off about 25 pieces of information we could actually sell.\" So they set about determining what new services State Street could feasibly offer, and how to package these into a new business model for the bank, one where the revenue potential was much higher. Managers produced a large egg-shaped chart, a graphical depiction dividing the future State Street empire into revenue-producing activities. This was accompanied by a \"food chain analysis,\" an attempt to determine where the competition lay in different services, and where the greatest opportunities were for a higher margin. Central to the plan\\'s success, Carter notes, was the integration of IT strategy into the business and financial model. Staff had to support the new activities, including developing and managing migration to new information technology on a global basis. Carter warns that whenever a company shifts to a new operating model, \"it must protect traditional revenue sources, as the new strategic revenue generators may be delayed.\" He advises as well that \"early wins are essential to convince people that resist change, that change is irresistible.\" This might mean attacking more easily won targets first, to prove that the model works and to banish employee skepticism. And a company might need to defend its performance (long-term aims) against Wall Street critics seeking higher short-term earnings.',\n","       'AskERIC is a personalized Internet-based service providing education information to teachers, librarians, counselors, administrators, parents, and anyone interested in education.

Extra, extra, browse all about it! The newspaper (as we know it) is history. As David Thorburn handily describes the situation: \"The younger the cohort is, the less interested it is in printed materials and the more committed to emerging technologies. The implication is, within 25 to 30 years, there won\\'t be people who want to read newspapers.\" These panelists discuss newspapers\\' transformation in the digital age. While Dan Gillmor thinks it would be a tragedy if traditional newspapers didn\\'t survive, the current Internet- based democratization of media, with easily accessed \"tools of production,\" isn\\'t all bad. \"Journalism has been a lecture, where we tell you what the news is, and you either buy it or you don\\'t. Now it\\'s moving into something like a conversation.\" In this changed world, news organizations ask the public what they know about things. Remember the camera phone photo from the London Underground bombings? Imagine if this technology had been available at the time of John F. Kennedy\\'s assassination, muses Gillmor. It wouldn\\'t have been one guy with a camera, \"but 1,000, all connected to digital networks. We\\'d know if anyone was on the grassy knoll or just one guy in the book depository.\" Ellen Foley acknowledges that her widely read Wisconsin State Journal is a rarity among smaller newspapers. \"Unless you\\'re in prison, you\\'re reading our paper, but you\\'re not paying for it,\" she says. She attributes her paper\\'s robust reach to its Midwest philosophy of \"being a good neighbor.\" This means journalists must not only share information, but listen to what readers want. She applies this approach both to the newspaper and to the paper\\'s website, where users vote every day on what makes the front page. Foley worries about the financial viability of her paper, but also hopes that the revenue generated from 21st century Internet technology \"will support the 20th century values of telling the truth and making a difference in communities.\" Alex Beam pronounces himself a \"skeptic of citizens\\' media, whatever that means.\" He\\'s grateful to papers like The New York Times, which \"get slammed for saying things people don\\'t want presented. This is a time of transition where we haven\\'t quite balanced the equities of the readers and the professionals.\" And don\\'t count on linked websites to aid newspaper survival, says Beam. As The Boston Globe is learning, it\\'s \"a hard business model\" for the web to generate money either through ads, or by charging readers for access to specialized material, like Boston Red Sox coverage or opinion columns. Beam says, \"We haven\\'t found the price point for editorial judgment, for mediating experience. We\\'re still floundering. In the so-called traditional newspaper industry, there\\'s a lot of fear about what we can charge for this.\"',\n","       'This is a lesson plan created for a First grade classroom. \\xa0Students will be writing a discriptive report about an animal. \\xa0After researching and writing the report students will create a digital story to present the information that they have learned.',\n","       'This video was recorded at Summer Schools in Logic and Learning, Canberra 2009.

For a training dataset with a nonexhaustive list of classes, i.e. some classes are not yet known and hence are not represented, the resulting learning problem is ill-defined. In this case a sample from a missing class is incorrectly classified to one of the existing classes. For some applications the cost of misclassifying a sample could be negligible. However, the significance of this problem can better be acknowledged when the potentially undesirable consequences of incorrectly classifying a food pathogen as a nonpathogen are considered. Our research is directed towards the real-time detection of food pathogens using optical-scattering technology. Bacterial colonies consisting of the progeny of a single parent cell scatter light at 635 nm to produce unique forward-scatter signatures. These spectral signatures contain descriptive characteristics of bacterial colonies, which can be used to identify bacteria cultures in real time. One bottleneck that remains to be addressed is the nonexhaustive nature of the training library. It is very difficult if not impractical to collect samples from all possible bacteria colonies and construct a digital library with an exhaustive set of scatter signatures. This study deals with the real-time detection of samples from a missing class and the associated problem of learning with a nonexhaustive training dataset. Our proposed method assumes a common prior for the set of all classes, known and missing. The parameters of the prior are estimated from the samples of the known classes. This prior is then used to generate a large number of samples to simulate the space of missing classes. Finally a Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier is implemented using samples from real as well as simulated classes. Experiments performed with samples collected for 28 bacteria subclasses favor the proposed approach over the state of the art.',\n","       'The ATETV project delivers web-based videos to connect students to careers in advanced technology.
