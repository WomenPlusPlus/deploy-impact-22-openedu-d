# Introduction 

As Classifiers, we did the following to build an ontology by identifying subtopics using keyword extraction and zero-shot classification.

- Retrieve data for the data scientists to work on
- The data scientists extracted the subtopics
- Zero-shot classification was used on new data for classification into these subtopics

You can look at the classification the model did on new observations by using zero-shot classification [in this file](./docs/output_robotics_new_observations.xlsx).
