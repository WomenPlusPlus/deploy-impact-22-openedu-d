It’s time to add the 4th R – Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic and algoRithmic thinking. In a world where the majority of new jobs require science, technology and math skills, it is time our Liberal Arts majors get IT (Information Technology)! While employers recognize and value the importance of liberal education and the liberal arts, they also want liberal arts graduates who are not digitally challenged. Many employers report a “skills gap” as they have trouble finding recent graduates qualified with ample digital skills to fill various positions. Meanwhile, a national educational movement in computer coding instruction is growing at lightning speeds in schools across the US and many consider coding more like a basic life skill (which might someday lead to a great job) rather than an extracurricular activity. App Inventor (AI) serves to narrow this skills gap and increase the versatility of students to become active creators of technology and “digitally” ready for the workplace rather than just being passive consumers of technology. Sales of hand-held devices (smartphones, tablets and phablets) are exploding. These on-line, social, and increasingly mobile computing devices are ubiquitous and offer visual, tactile and personal experiences as never before. Mobile devices in our education landscape are digital and portable - with multimedia capabilities to access the Internet, and are drastically changing the ways we teach and learn. Developing applications for such devices enables digital natives to experience mobile technology as active creators rather than just passive consumers of technology.Learning GoalsLearn Apps DevelopmentLearn Digital Skills (essential for a Liberal Arts major)"

Key topics include the role of business, the global economic and legal environment, ethics, marketing, accounting and finance, and managing processes and operations. Enriched OER content (text, video, simulations, etc.) orients students to the shifting business landscape and prepares them for success in business program curriculum and the workplace.This course was written by Linda Williams of Tidewater Community College and Lumen Learning and is supplemented by content from OpenStax Principles of Economics, Boundless Business, and videos from multiple sources.-----------------------------Review------------------------------------------------------------------Our CriteriaAccuracy and CurrencyHow accurate is the material, based on current standards in the field?If the material is inaccurate, does it acknowledge conflicts in perspectives and changes over time?If the material is outdated, does it serve other purposes (to provide historical perspective, to provoke discussion, or to serve as an example)?Within this review of Lumen's Open Educational Resource (OER) Introduction to Business by Linda Williams, I chose to pick one part of the course content to review - Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR). The material is based on current standards within the business ethics foundation. This portion of CSR goes over current terminology such as ""green-washing"" and connects to current controversies within CSR, which is important to students going forward in business. Thus far, I see that this information serves discussion purposes, as well as historical relevance. The chapter starts with President Calvin Coolidge's vantage to of business not being a part of business, outside of people being a foundation to business.BiasHow does the material acknowledge perspectives (of the authors, of other experts in the field, of critical voices, etc.)?How does the material present facts, opinions, and judgments?How does the licensing of the material allow the instructor to remix or revise biased content?The material doesn't acknowledge the author's perspective, which doesn't give a bias. It does present facts within the chapter. In my review, I am unsure if educators can revise the content; but, educators can add portions of the course OER to their classrooms, i.e. CANVAS or Blackboard.Ability to Overcome Barriers to EngagementHow does the material engage students? Does the material reflect student experience and views?How do students access the material? Does it require technology skills? Can it be accessed in multiple ways through multiple means?How does the material/resource respond to accommodative and adaptive technologies?In reviewing the CSR chapter, I was happy to see video supporting ""Increased Pressure from Consumers"" subsection of the chapter. This could be a great reflection of students views.  This material does require technology skills in order for access to this chapter and OER book. In my review, I was able to connect to the OER course and chapter through a desktop computer, but I did not connect via a mobile phone. For accessibility (ADA) purposes, it is possible to use ""talk to text"" or ""speechnotes"" with this OER.Publishing Process & LicensingHow was the material published? What kind of review/editing process was used?How is the material licensed and stored? Can it be remixed and revised as needed? Is it subscription-based and if so, who pays for the subscription?What is the 'permanence' of this material? Is it temporal (likely to be removed or taken down)? What would be the back-up plan if license/access to this material is lost?Depending if the educator uses ""Waymaker"", ""OHM"", or ""Candela"", each student could pay between $10 to $25 per student as a subscription, in comparison to over $100 for a textbook. Lumen offer workshops and training within their OER program.Relevant to Course & InstitutionHow does this material align with course objectives and learning activities?At the beginning of the CSR chapter,  it gives student outcomes such has the definition of CSR, describe the impact of CSR to its stakeholders, and give examples to students of what CSR is within business. This material is align to ""Introduction to Business"" student outcomes, as well as to AACSB International accreditation.Relevant to StudentsHow does the material reflect student interests and learning goals?How does the material give student autonomy in their learning?How does the material encourage interaction, critical thinking, and deeper learning/processing"

Sciences,,"In this two year study funded by the California Energy Commission and S.D. Bechtel, a committee of individuals from major energy research institutions in California develops strategies to meet Executive Order S-3-05. Executive Order S-3-05 requires California to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. To accomplish this, CO2 levels will need to drop from 13 tons CO2e per capita (2005) to 1.6 tons CO2e per capita (2050) while the population continues to grow and energy use is expected to double. To offer a solution to this challenge, multiple ""energy system portraits"" are developed with combinations of nuclear, biomass, electricity, and fossil fuels with carbon capturing systems. It's concluded by applying key aggressive strategies and investing in multiple technologies, implementations, research, development, and innovation, California can meet executive order S-3-05."

Humanities,,"""I never knew a whole family to live together, till all were grown up, in my life,"" recalls Lewis Clarke of his twenty-five years enslaved in Kentucky.1 Families were separated due to sale, escape, early death from poor health, suicide, and murder by a slaveholder, overseer, slave patroller, or other dominant person. Separation also occurred within the plantation itself, e.g., by segregating ""field slaves"" from ""house servants,"" removing children from parents to live together with a slave caretaker, or bringing children fathered by the slaveholder to live in the ""Big House."" How, then, did the slave family provide solace and identity? ""What the family does, and what the family did for African Americans,"" writes historian Deborah White Gray, ""was create a world outside of the world of work. It allowed for significant others. It allowed a male slave to be more than just a brute beast. It allowed him to be a father, to be a son. It allowed women to be mothers and to take on roles that were outside of that of a slave, of a servant.""2 When did the enslaved child realize how his or her family life differed from the slave-holder's? How did enslaved adults cope with the forced disintegration of their families? Here we read a collection of texts—two letters, a memoir, and interview excerpts—to consider these questions. (See also Theme II: ENSLAVEMENT, #2, Sale.)"
Humanities,,"Legalized slavery has been abolished around the world, yet human trafficking remains a significant problem. Though slavery may not take the exact forms it did in the nineteenth century, approximately 45.8 million persons in 167 countries endure modern forms of slavery. Fellow Laura Murphy, Associate Professor of English and Director of the Modern Slavery Research Project at Loyola University New Orleans, is currently at work on a book about the way survivors of forced labor have mobilized the discourse of slavery in the twenty-first century to reinvigorate their struggles for freedom.In this podcast, Murphy discusses the generic conventions of the slave narrative and how they complicate our notions of what it means to be free. For instance, in what she terms the “not-yet-freedom narrative,” survivors of slavery find their lives still circumscribed by systemic injustices, even after emancipation. By approaching the topic of slavery through the lens provided by literary analysis, Murphy argues it is possible to discover new insights into the conventions surrounding modern enslavement and more fully understand the experiences of those caught up in them."
Humanities,,"In this lesson students will analyze a private letter that President Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) sent to Robert Livingston (1746–1813), his minister plenipotentiary (ambassador) to France, regarding the negotiations for what would become the Louisiana Purchase. Livingston and James Monroe (1758–1831, 6th president of the US) negotiated the Louisiana Purchase Treaty. It is important to note that at the time this letter was written — April 18, 1802 — the area had not yet been offered for sale.In this letter Jefferson, unaware of the possibility of outright purchase, focuses upon retaining commercial access to the Mississippi River and rights of deposit (economic access) in New Orleans. He also comments upon the danger of an aggressive France locating outposts just across the Mississippi River from the United States. While some historians characterize Jefferson as a Francophile, in this letter Jefferson sees France as a potential enemy to the United States.This lesson allows students to contextualize what will become the Louisiana Purchase prior to its acquisition by viewing the Purchase through a lens of national economic and military defense rather than an act of territorial expansion. As Jefferson considers the possibility of an aggressive France led by Napoleon Bonaparte on America’s doorstep, he states, “…perhaps nothing since the revolutionary war has produced more uneasy sensations through the body of the nation.” Original spellings and punctuation are retained.This lesson is divided into two parts, both accessible below. The text is accompanied by close reading questions, student interactives, and an optional follow-up assignment.

Humanities,,"In this lesson students will explore some of the doubts and misgivings that arose as the Continental Congress debated whether or not to add a bill of rights to the Constitution. They will investigate a letter James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson on October 17, 1788, in which Madison discusses the pros and cons of a bill of rights. It is part of a series of letters these men exchanged on the topic. Jefferson, who was in Paris at the time, strongly supported inserting a list of fundamental liberties into the Constitution, and he asked Madison to keep him abreast of the debate. In this letter Madison not only updates Jefferson on the bill’s progress but also explains his thoughts about a bill of rights and its role in the American Constitution.We have excerpted three passages from Madison’s letter, each accompanied by a series of close reading analytical questions for students to answer. The first excerpt explains the context of the debate, including reasons why a bill of rights might not be necessary. The second explores Madison’s reasons for supporting a bill of rights, and the third discusses how he believed such a list of rights, if written, should be structured. We have provided a short summary at the beginning of each excerpt. Spellings are retained from the original document.You will find two interactive exercises in this lesson. The first allows students to review vocabulary found throughout the text. The second, recommended for use after you have conducted the close reading, reviews the central points of the textual analysis. You may want to use its first slide to direct whole class discussion in which you ask students to support their answers with evidence from the text. The second slide provides the correct responses with textual support.It is important to remember that here the term “majority” refers to large groups of powerful politicians and legislators, not to a mass of voters. Moreover, Madison did not conceive of “minorities” as we do today — groups like women, African-Americans, Latinos, or other social or ethnic groups. Rather, when he uses the word, and when we use it in this lesson, it simply refers to a political group whose numbers are less than the majority.This lesson consists of two parts, both accessible below. The teacher’s guide includes a background note, the text analysis with responses to the close reading questions, access to the interactive exercises, and an optional follow-up assignment. The student’s version, an interactive worksheet that can be e-mailed, contains all of the above except the responses to the close reading questions and the follow-up assignment."

Humanities,,"Context, purpose and audience. There are two broad types of assumptions that designers must identify and address: the first type are assumptions they, as designers, have as they begin a project; the second type are assumptions that are ambient in the project context–assumptions that many of the project stakeholders either hold or frequently experience. In both cases, naming the assumption and developing an articulation for how that assumption can be reconsidered can help direct a project toward greater impact.This lesson is designed to help participants reframe these two types of assumptions. It can be used with design students from high school to continuing (adult) education. It is best delivered towards the end of the initial phase of design research (“Empathize” phase, to use the parlance of Stanford), after students have conducted interviews and other forms of research.The lesson offers five reframe patterns. These are meant to help students identify particularly powerful articulations of reframed assumptions by providing five different jumping-off points for ideation. The patterns are best introduced and used lightly: as provocations rather than as a formula to rigidly follow.We illustrate these reframe patterns using examples from disability studies. Thus, this lesson also serves as a “trojan horse” to infuse core design justice concepts."

Humanities,,"This course explores the causes, course, and consequences of the American Civil War, from the 1840s to 1877. The primary goal of the course is to understand the multiple meanings of a transforming event in American history. Those meanings may be defined in many ways: national, sectional, racial, constitutional, individual, social, intellectual, or moral. Four broad themes are closely examined: the crisis of union and disunion in an expanding republic; slavery, race, and emancipation as national problem, personal experience, and social process; the experience of modern, total war for individuals and society; and the political and social challenges of Reconstruction."

Humanities,,"PDF Link to summary and appreciation: PDF : https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pEm0fne9Zo1Ke2tDNSF3X_vqfHrgWwg/view?usp=sharing""Song of the Open Road"" is a poem by Sir Walt(er) Whitman from his 1856 collection ‘Leaves of Grass’. It is widely admired by people of all age groups.It symbolically speaks about self-awareness, free-will, tenderness of heart, mobility, love and freedom.Out of the fifteen sections of the original poem, Yuvakbharati English book of Std. XII has prescribed the first section of the poem. This multi-themed poem has been written in free verse, and motivates us to cross hurdles, be optimistic and live in a free and democratic society. The title is apt as it depicts the poet’s free will and carefree tone. It appeals to the readers as it urges them to join the poet’s journey of the open road which is democratic and free.Indoors is a place of secret and silent despair. It's only roads where people walk with some meaning and purpose. A road is classless and the most democratic segment of a society.Road symbolizes mobility. So don't stay at one place, move ahead. Mobility makes you wise and versatile!Summary of the first section:Sir Walt(er) Whitman’s “Song of the Open Road” is a celebration of travel - an ode to himself or any democratic individual. He embarks upon a journey “Afoot and light-hearted…” He is free to choose wherever he wishes. He chooses his own journey after being fed up of experiencing four-walled home spun politics, high philosophies and bookish disciplines. He feels self-contented and doesn’t desire anything more in life. He doesn’t want the influence of powerful or wiser people who appear good in their power and persona (constellations). He doesn’t want their support as he himself is his good fortune. He is the maker of his own luck. Mother Earth would take care of him. He appeals to his fellow-travellers to travel with him on that democratic path in which he himself is travelling. The powers and influence of great people are nothing when compared to a winding, tortuous road which bears stresses and turns of events due to passengers. The road bears our stress (burden), still takes us to the goals we had set for ourselves before commencing. There may be situations when difficulties would arise, but no shortcut or escaping would work. He tells the fellow Americans to understand the concept of freedom and break free from the fetters of conventional rules. In conclusion, he separates himself from the rest of the world by keeping himself in brackets and admits that he admires his delicious burdens because of their symbiotic relationship with each other - burdens fill him; he fills them in return!RegardsSudhir KhullarLicenseCreative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)"

Humanities,,"Communication is an art to express ideas and thoughts to people. Listening-Speaking-Reading-Writing remains the fundamental parts of communication. Whereas Listening and Reading are Receptive; Speaking and Writing are Expressive faculties. Communication can be divided into three basic components: they are Presentation Skills (a combination of verbal and non-verbal communication), Writing Skills and Conversation Skills. According to research, any communication includes 7 per cent spoken words, 38 per cent voice and tone, and 55 per cent body language. It is an interesting fact that 93 per cent of our daily communication is non-verbal. Females are found to have much better visual and auditory skills. Here in this essay, we are strictly confining ourselves to its non-verbal aspect."
Mathematics,,"This course covered the mathematical topics most directly related to computer science. Topics included: logic, relations, functions, basic set theory, countability and counting arguments, proof techniques, mathematical induction, graph theory, combinatorics, discrete probability, recursion, recurrence relations, and number theory. Emphasis will be placed on providing a context for the application of the mathematics within computer science. The analysis of algorithms requires the ability to count the number of operations in an algorithm. Recursive algorithms in particular depend on the solution to a recurrence equation, and a proof of correctness by mathematical induction. The design of a digital circuit requires the knowledge of Boolean algebra. Software engineering uses sets, graphs, trees and other data structures. Number theory is at the heart of secure messaging systems and cryptography. Logic is used in AI research in theorem proving and in database query systems. Proofs by induction and the more general notions of mathematical proof are ubiquitous in theory of computation, compiler design and formal grammars. Probabilistic notions crop up in architectural trade-offs in hardware design."

This resource is from PUMAS - Practical Uses of Math and Science - a collection of brief examples created by scientists and engineers showing how math and science topics taught in K-12 classes have real world applications."
Mathematics,,"Students will encounter the concept of a distribution, along with parameters that describe a distribution's ""typical"" values (average) and a distribution's spread (variance). To understand simple distributions and uncertainty propagation in the coming sections, it is necessary to be familiar with the concept of statistical independence. When two variables fluctuate independently, their covariance vanishes, and the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances."
Mathematics,,"The quadratic formula is easy to solve, yet sufficiently sophisticated that it provides insight into oscillations of masses connected by springs, as well as insight into chemical bonds between atoms. The purpose of this video is to illustrate what it means to find the ""zeros"" or ""roots"" of the quadratic equation, both using a graphical description, as well as by analytically completing the square to obtain the famous quadratic formula."
Mathematics,,"When a function depends on multiple independent variables, the curly-d symbol denotes slopes calculated by jiggling only one independent variable at a time.

Mathematics,,"The purpose of the first part of this video is to introduce the idea of summation and its notation using the Greek-letter Sigma. We practice working with sums by using Gauss's summation trick. In the second part of the video, we study examples of infinite series, one which converges to a finite number (geometric series), and one which diverges (harmonic series)."
Mathematics,,"When a derivative of a function appears on one side of an equation and the function appears somewhere on the other side, it is common to employ a series of manipulations of notation that are called separation of variables. This strategy is often presented in a way that makes it seem as though differentials were quantities that could be independently moved around an equation. The purpose of this video is to show that the same end result can be obtained more rigorously using u-substitution, in other words, using a ""change of variables."""
Mathematics,,"Students will see how the idea of a limit can be presented both in formal epsilon-delta-style terms, and using corresponding animations. After calculating a limit for a simple example function, we point out that limits do not always exist."

These include the power rule, the chain rule, the product and quotient rules, and the rules for differentiating sinusoidal functions."
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we introduce Euler's number by considering the problem of interest compounded continuously. After we obtain the power-series representation for exp(x), we explore its properties, in the next four video segments, to convince ourselves that exp(x) is literally an exponential function, meaning a number, approximately 2.71828, taken to the power x. In the final two segments, we present the natural logarithm and demonstrate that it is the anti-derivative of 1/x."
Mathematics,,"In the first part of this video introduction to combinatorics, we introduce factorial notation to efficiently describe the ways we can arrange distinguishable objects in a row. Next, we count the combinations of L objects that can be grabbed from a container of L + N total objects. Finally, we use the formula for combinations to derive the binomial theorem."
Mathematics,,"To continue our discussion of derivatives from preceding videos, we explain that the second derivative represents curvature. By combining knowledge of multiple derivatives, we can sometimes create Taylor series, which are local approximations of functions. As an example, we Taylor-expand sinusoidal functions and then use the results to iteratively approximate pi."
Mathematics,,"In this video, we become familiar with integrals, both by understanding them as sums of areas under plots of functions, and by understanding them as anti-derivatives. We present the u-substitution rule, which is the analog of the chain rule for differentiating composite functions."
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we study the distribution, average, and variance for the Bernoulli coin-toss process. The binomial distribution results from stringing together a series of coin tosses. In the second segment, we study the limit of ""rare"" events, which is described by the Poisson distribution."

Mathematics,,"In this video, we explore some concepts fundamental to algebra. To streamline the discussion of relationships between physical quantities, we introduce variables, functions, composition, and inverse. By thinking about the concept of an inverse function, we obtain our first glimpse of the imaginary root (i.e. square-root of -1) and the complex plane."
Mathematics,,"Using the complex exponentials described in the previous video, we show how oscillating systems can be modeled using ""rotation matrices."" One strategy for determining whether a dynamical system supports oscillations is to look for complex eigenvectors and eigenvalues."

Mathematics,,"The quadrature formula relates the fluctuations of a function to fluctuations in the variables on which the function depends. In this derivation, we approximate a multivariable function using a Taylor expansion, and we assume that fluctuations in the underlying variables are statistically independent, which allows us to apply an identity previously derived in the unit on statistics. Namely, ""variances of sums are sums of variances"" for variables that fluctuate independently."

This booklet can be found on the Space Math@NASA website."
Mathematics,,"The aim of this session is to motivate students to understand why we might want to do proofs, why proofs are important, and how they can help us. In particular, the student will learn the following: proofs can help you to really see WHY a result is true; problems that are easy to state can be hard to solve (Fermat's Last Theorem); sometimes statements which appear to be intuitively obvious may turn out to be false (the Hospitals paradox); the answer to a question will often depend crucially on the definitions you are working with. Target audience: suitable for anyone with a knowledge of elementary algebra and prime numbers, as may be obtained by studying A level mathematics."
Mathematics,,"Why do quantitative biologists sometimes claim that mRNA copy numbers are Poisson distributed in simple models of gene transcription? The first video segment addresses this question under the simplifying assumption that mRNA degradation occurs after a well-defined, deterministic lifetime, and the second segment illustrates the same basic concept for the more realistic situation in which degradation is stochastic."
Mathematics,,Students will learn a sample-variance curve fitting method that can be used to determine whether a set of experimental data appears to have been generated by a model. This method is based on minimizing the reduced chi-squared value. This video includes a reminder to inspect normalized residuals before reporting fitted parameters.
Mathematics,,"The purpose of this video tutorial is to review a couple ways in which we think about numbers. Thinking in terms of street numbers, money in bank accounts, and quantum particles (e.g. Bose-Einstein condensate) is contrasted with focusing on associating numbers with distinguishable manipulatives, as is more familiar in K-8 courses. This video concludes with a reminder that the symbol ""infinity"" is not, itself, a number."
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we describe the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics. The direct product notation we introduce in the second segment helps us to discuss the states available to a collection of many parts, which helps us, in turn, to derive the Boltzmann factor in the third segment. The fourth video segment explains how the Boltzmann factor helps us to calculate average properties for systems in thermal contact with large baths and introduces entropy (Greek letter sigma), free energy (F), and the partition function (Z)."
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we estimate properties of a parent distribution (i.e. mean and standard deviation) from a sample of a finite collection of data measurements, and we describe the standard error (SE). In the second segment, we derive the famous square-root of n factor that appears in the SE formula. The third video segment describes the visual comparison of error bars, and the fourth segment warns against a mistake that can generate inappropriate claims of statistical significance during this kind of analysis."

Mathematics,,"To describe how oscillations are supported in systems of differential equations, we present a classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" picture of two-dimensional oscillations, and we analyze how trajectories change as nullclines are arranged at different angles in the phase plane. In addition to models based on traditional systems of differential equations, dynamical systems with time delays and dynamical systems with stochastic fluctuation (i.e. stochastic resonance) can also support oscillations."
Mathematics,,"In the first video, we present a biological circuit topology from Ma, Trusina, El-Samad, Lim, and Tang, ""Defining network topologies that can achieve biochemical adaptation,"" Cell, 138: 760-773 (2009). This topology supports adaptation, which is not the absence of change in response to stimulation/stress, but, instead, the ability to produce delayed compensation for those changes. In the second video, we summarize the method of almost linear stability analysis used to solve for the dynamics of this example system."
Mathematics,,"In the master-equation formalism, a set of differential equations describe the time-evolution of the probability distribution of an ensemble of systems. This can be used, for example, to describe the varied mRNA copy numbers found in individual cells in a population."
Mathematics,,"In a toy model of a cell, protein X is produced according to a translation rate coefficient and eliminated according to a degradation rate coefficient. The protein copy number at which the rates for these processes balance is called the steady-state level, and the time it takes for a cell initially containing zero copies of protein X to accumulate half the steady-state level is called the _ŃŇrise time._Ń Surprisingly, the ""rise time"" depends on the degradation rate coefficient only. The classic textbook presentation of this topic is found in Alon, An Introduction to Systems Biology: Design Principles of Biological Circuits, Boca Raton: Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2007 (p. 18-22)."

Mathematics,,"In this deterministic cellular automata model, interactions between neighboring automata are described using a prisoner's dilemma. Limiting dispersal of seeds of annual plants can permit heterogeneous co-existence, whereas thorough mixing instead allows one subpopulation to dominate quickly."
Mathematics,,"After heuristically deriving Stirling's approximation in the first video segment, we outline a simple example of the central limit theorem for the case of the binomial distribution. In the final segment, we explain how the central limit theorem is used to suggest that physical experiments are characterized by normally-distributed (Gaussian) fluctuations while fluctuations in biological experiments are said to fill out log-normal distributions."
Mathematics,,"Even when we model the dynamics of the abundances of molecules inside biological systems using calculus, it is important to remember that underlying behavior can be apparently random (""stochastic""). Even a deterministic system containing components moving in periodic ways can, at early times, support dynamics that appear disordered. The behavior of systems containing complicated collections of interacting parts can be difficult to predict with accuracy (chaos). Finally, systems can display stochasticity because the outcomes of measurements on quantum systems are indeterminate in a fundamental way. Random processes are modeled using Markov models."
Mathematics,,"As science extension activities, this book of problems introduces students to mapping the shape of the Milky Way galaxy, and how to identify the various kinds of galaxies in our universe.

It also provides exercises in plotting points on a Cartesian plane to map the various features of our Milky Way."
Mathematics,,"Biological systems (e.g. cells) can make stochastic transitions between phenotypes (e.g. states of relatively increased or decreased drug resistance). This means that an initially drug-sensitive population can generate relatively drug-resistant subpopulations. This video presents a metronomogram, which is a tool for understanding whether such stochastic transitions can provide an opportunity for therapeutic treatment. Citation: Liao D, Estevez-Salmeron L, and Tlsty TD (2012) ""Conceptualizing a tool to optimize therapy based on dynamic heterogeneity,"" Phys. Biol. 9:065005."
Mathematics,,"In the first part of this video, we derive the law of mass action from one example of a picture of molecular collisions. For this course, we use the ""law of mass action"" to refer to an idea that chemical reaction kinetic rates can be expressed using products of the abundances of reactants raised to exponents. Studying cooperativity and Hill functions in the second part of the video allows us to investigate a simple example of bistability in the third video segment."
Mathematics,,"The stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA, Kinetic Monte Carlo, Gillespie algorithm) produces an example trajectory for a particular member of a probabilistic ensemble by looping over the following steps. The current state of the system is used to determine the likelihood of each possible chemical reaction in relative comparison to the likelihoods for the other possible reactions, as well as to determine when the next reaction is expected. Pseudo-random numbers are drawn to ""roll the dice"" to determine exactly when the next reaction will proceed, and which kind of reaction it will happen to be."
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we present a cartoon model of a weighted chain, which can be regarded as an approximation for a polymer under tension (e.g. a strand of DNA being stretched out using optical tweezers). The Hamiltonian and partition function for this system are described in the second segment. Finally, in the third segment, we calculate the average energy and elongation of the chain."

Mathematics,,"We use eigenvector-eigenvalue analysis to walk through a simple quasispecies model described in Bull, Meyers, and Lachmann, ""Quasispecies made simple,"" PLoS Comp Biol, 1(6):e61 (2005). The dominance of a genotype depends, not merely on its ability to breed quickly (i.e. the rudimentary concept of survival of the fittest), but also on its ability to breed ""true."""
Mathematics,,"In the first video segment, we analyze the population dynamics for a test-tube of cells that affect each others' likelihoods of replication when they collide. The particular example we use is a prisoner's dilemma, which has the almost paradoxical property that survival of the relatively most fit leads overall fitness to decrease. In the second video segment, we suggest that the population dynamics from the first segment can be related to an analysis that uses payoff matrices found in traditional game theory."

Social Sciences,,"This educational video features Sperm whales and has an accompanying lesson plan to teach about Sound in the Sea. The Sperm whale holds many records. It is the deepest-diving whale on Earth, the largest toothed whale on Earth and has the largest brain on the planet too. On top of that, it has a reputation for being a vicious beast, thanks in part to Herman Melville's Moby Dick. But the real Sperm whale is a lot different than people think. It has a highly-evolved social life, operates at depths where nobody can see them most of the time, and uses sonar which is so sophisticated that it makes the Navy's electronics look like toys. Sperm whales are very hard to find and even harder to film. In the Caribbean, Jonathan repeatedly attempts to get close to the elusive whales, until finally he succeeds and has an incredible experience eye to eye with a giant who investigates him with powerful sonar clicks. Please see the accompanying lesson plan for educational objectives, discussion points and classroom activities."

Social Sciences,,"In this lesson students will explore some of the doubts and misgivings that arose as the Continental Congress debated whether or not to add a bill of rights to the Constitution. They will investigate a letter James Madison wrote to Thomas Jefferson on October 17, 1788, in which Madison discusses the pros and cons of a bill of rights. It is part of a series of letters these men exchanged on the topic. Jefferson, who was in Paris at the time, strongly supported inserting a list of fundamental liberties into the Constitution, and he asked Madison to keep him abreast of the debate. In this letter Madison not only updates Jefferson on the bill’s progress but also explains his thoughts about a bill of rights and its role in the American Constitution.We have excerpted three passages from Madison’s letter, each accompanied by a series of close reading analytical questions for students to answer. The first excerpt explains the context of the debate, including reasons why a bill of rights might not be necessary. The second explores Madison’s reasons for supporting a bill of rights, and the third discusses how he believed such a list of rights, if written, should be structured. We have provided a short summary at the beginning of each excerpt. Spellings are retained from the original document.You will find two interactive exercises in this lesson. The first allows students to review vocabulary found throughout the text. The second, recommended for use after you have conducted the close reading, reviews the central points of the textual analysis. You may want to use its first slide to direct whole class discussion in which you ask students to support their answers with evidence from the text. The second slide provides the correct responses with textual support.It is important to remember that here the term “majority” refers to large groups of powerful politicians and legislators, not to a mass of voters. Moreover, Madison did not conceive of “minorities” as we do today — groups like women, African-Americans, Latinos, or other social or ethnic groups. Rather, when he uses the word, and when we use it in this lesson, it simply refers to a political group whose numbers are less than the majority.This lesson consists of two parts, both accessible below. The teacher’s guide includes a background note, the text analysis with responses to the close reading questions, access to the interactive exercises, and an optional follow-up assignment. The student’s version, an interactive worksheet that can be e-mailed, contains all of the above except the responses to the close reading questions and the follow-up assignment."

If there is to be any coherent behavior in the system, it will have to to arise from competition and cooperation among the agents themselves. The overall behavior of the system is the result of a huge number of decisions made every moment"" by many individual agents. Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems requires tools that themselves are complex to create and understand. Shalizi defines Agent Based Modeling as ""An agent is a persistent thing which has some state we find worth representing, and which interacts with other agents, mutually modifying each otherŰŞs states. The components of an agent-based model are a collection of agents and their states, the rules governing the interactions of the agents and the environment within which they live."" This course will explore the theory of CAS and their main properties. It will also teach you how to work with Agent Based Models in order to model and understand CAS."

Sustainability,,"For farmers, growing crops is just one step in running a successful farmâ€”making the farm or market garden economically viable requires another suite of skills, including finding land, planning what crops to grow, marketing the crops, and managing income and expenses. This resource builds on our experience educating hundreds of apprentice growers in organic production, farm and business planning, direct marketing at a roadside farm stand, and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) management through hands-on training in the running of our 100-member CSA program. Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability: Resources for Instructors is organized into six units, three focusing on marketing and three covering other topics related to making a small farm economically viable. Included are lessons and resources for running a CSA project, selling at farmers' markets, forming collaborative marketing groups and grower cooperatives, and selling to restaurants. Also covered are strategies to improve small farm planning, including enterprise visioning and market assessment; creating a business plan, including marketing and crop plans; and managing cash flow. Land tenure options such as cash-rent leases from non-profits, shared ownership models, conservation easements, and community land trusts are reviewed as additional mechanisms for addressing the complex issue of the economic viability of small-scale agriculture. This resource also reviews the trends and factors that influence small-scale agriculture's economics, and provides an overview of produce marketing in the U.S. The training manual is designed for â€“ â€¢Instructors at college and universities, agriculture organizations, farm-training programs, apprenticeship programs â€¢Agricultural extension personnel â€¢Farmers with interns â€¢Growers, teachers, and organizers at urban farms, community gardens, and food projects with direct-marketing outlets This instructor's resource features class and field demonstration outlines, trainee exercises, and resource materials, with a focus on CSA. The manual can be used in a classroom setting or adapted for other training formats, such as short courses, conferences, and field days."

Sustainability,,"Many factors influence the success and survival rate of a population of living things. Explore several factors that can determine the survival of a population of sheep in this NetLogo model. Start with a model of unlimited grass available to the sheep and watch what happens to the sheep population! Next try to keep the population under control by removing sheep periodically. Change the birthrate, grass regrowth rate, and the amount of energy rabbits get from the grass to keep a stable population."
Sustainability,,California’s Foster Care and related reforms mandate that public agencies build or enhance shared leadership and decision-making processes. While many counties have begun to collaborate in this effort; there is a continuum of integration which; if pursued; will sustain and support long-term shared outcomes; return financial investments; and empower youth and family service recipients in unique and value-added ways. This workshop will give attendees an opportunity to both understand the elements of successful inter-agency management and begin to strategize their own partnerships.
Sustainability,,"It has been said that “teamwork makes the dream work,”and our dream is for every child and family to succeed.

Sustainability,,"Runway extension, construction of works in protected areas, subsidizing sustainable projects... they all happen within a design space, limited amongst others by legal rules and requirements. To make optimal use of the design space, you have to know about these rules and requirements. When does a contract have to be tendered out, what rules are then applicable, what can be subsidized and what are the restrictions, how to comply with air quality requirements and can a frog really block a project? What alternative designs can be given in order to avoid legal problems? These and other problems will be addressed in this course."
Sustainability,,"If we believe that families hold the keys of wisdom to knowing what they really need in order to be self sufficient and thriving, then should we be extremely thoughtful about the ways in which we communicate with all members within the circle of support for each family? Should we consider modifications to current thought processes as to how, in the future, we can train our own staff to partner most effectively? Using a technique called appreciative inquiry, participants will explore conversations about how listening and the conscious pooling of collective strengths can transform how we relate to each other every day in our most significant and impactful field of work. Goal setting strategies will be presented for discussion and one of the most effective secrets to creating, sustaining and deepening the quality of our relationships will be revealed for consideration among the engaged participants in this workshop."
Sustainability,,"This course will explore how Americans have confronted energy challenges since the end of World War II. Beginning in the 1970s, Americans worried about the supply of energy. As American production of oil declined, would the US be able to secure enough fuel to sustain their high consumption lifestyles? At the same time, Americans also began to fear the environmental side affects of energy use. Even if the US had enough fossil fuel, would its consumption be detrimental to health and safety? This class examines how Americans thought about these questions in the last half-century. We will consider the political, diplomatic, economic, cultural, and technological aspects of the energy crisis. Topics include nuclear power, suburbanization and the new car culture, the environmental movement and the challenges of clean energy, the Middle East and supply of oil, the energy crisis of the 1970s, and global warming."
Sustainability,,"This is the output of Etwinning Project Agents of Change: Young Voices for the Environment!The challenge is to integrate environmental education concepts into all aspects of quality education by considering three domains: the environment, education and society. Students will need basic knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities to understand the principles of sustainable development. Reorienting the existing learning environments of schools towards eco-friendly schools is the next innovative and relevant step towards enhanced quality education.While young people are among the most vulnerable to climate change, they need not be considered passive or helpless victims. Through education, projects and action, young people can contribute to every aspect of climate change policymaking, mitigation and adaptation. Youth are powerful agents of change.In this project we are aiming to bring together school students from across different European countries (to promote mutual understanding, increase leadership skills, and prepare them to make a difference."
Sustainability,,"The English colonists in North America in the seventeenth century were part of an early modern global communication network, and yet at the same time, they were painfully isolated. They had been encouraged to risk the three-thousand-mile ocean voyage across the North Atlantic by a steady flow of hopeful reports from the New World that had been circulating in Europe for over a hundred years in the form of explorers’ letters, maps, and travel accounts. But once they were there in the early English settlements at Jamestown, Plymouth, and Massachusetts Bay, they were frequently cut off from the news networks they had previously known: books, pamphlets, newspapers, letters, and face-to-face communication with family and friends. They longed for news from home, especially during the news-drenched decades of civil strife in England beginning in the 1640s. They labored to sustain and improve the transatlantic flow of information and news from England and Europe to America.This essay and collection of primary sources explores the topic of Colonial Print Culture."
