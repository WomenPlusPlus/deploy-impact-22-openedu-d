Other,Railways,"Have you ever wondered what it takes to get your train on the right platform at the scheduled time every day?Understanding the complexity behind today’s sophisticated railway systems will give you a better insight into how this safe and reliable transportation system works. We will show you the many factors which are involved and how multiple people, behind the scenes, have a daily task that enables you to get from home to work. Journey with us into the world of rail – a complex system that connects people, cities and countries.Railway systems entail much more than a train and a track. They are based on advanced technical and operational solutions, dealing with continuously changing demands for more efficient transport for both passengers and freight every day. Each system consists of many components that must be properly integrated: from trains, tracks, stations, signaling and control systems, through monitoring, maintenance and the impact on cities, landscape and people. This integration is the big challenge and the source of many train delays, inconvenient connections and other issues that impact our society.This engineering course attempts to tackle those issues by introducing you to a holistic approach to railway systems engineering. You will learn how the system components depend on each other to create a reliable, efficient and state-of-the-art network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Railways,"Auguste Rodin, The Gates of Hell​, 1880-1917, plaster (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) Speakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker When the building, earlier on the site of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was destroyed by fire during the Commune in 1871, plans were drawn up to replace it with a museum of decorative arts. Rodin won the competition to design a great set of doors for its entry way. Although the museum was never built, Rodin continued to work on the doors. They became an ongoing project; a grand stage for his sculptural ideas. It's fitting that the plaster of this great unfinished sculpture, The Gates of Hell, is now on display at the d'Orsay, the former railway terminal that was built on this site instead of the museum of decorative arts and that, by lovely coincidence, was converted into one of the world's great art museums.

Other,Railways,"In 1862, Congress passed and President Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Bill, which granted public land and funds to build a transcontinental railroad. The Central Pacific Railroad would lay tracks from California heading east, and the Union Pacific Railroad would lay tracks from the Missouri River west. The photograph taken in Placer County, ""Grading the Central Pacific Railroad,"" shows some of the construction. Work on the railroad was physically difficult and at times dangerous, and attracting workers was a challenge. The majority of the Central Pacific's laborers were Chinese. A Chinese worker is shown in the image ""Heading (top cut) of East Portal, Tunnel No. 8."" Both railroad companies actively recruited Chinese laborers because they were regarded as hard workers and were willing to accept a lower wage than white workers, mostly Irish immigrants. As construction progressed, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific competed to see which could lay the most track each day. A photograph of a sign near Promontory Park, Utah, commemorates the day that Central Pacific crews laid an unprecedented 10 miles of track. The meeting of the two sets of tracks ? the ""gold spike"" ceremony ? took place on May 10, 1869. Several photographs and drawings depict this historic moment. Now the country was connected as never before: a journey between San Francisco and New York that previously took up to six months now took only days. The photograph ""High Bridge in Loop,"" from Views from a Trip to California, shows a train passing quickly through a mountain pass. The transcontinental railroad allowed people to travel more, farther, and in pleasant conditions, as reflected in the photograph ""Commissary Car, 'Elkhorn Club.'"" The photograph ""Knights of Pythias at the Santa Fe Railway Station, Anaheim"" shows an example of the popularity of trains. Even as the transcontinental railroad brought the new country together, it brought change to the world of Native Americans. The tracks ran through a number of tribal territories, bringing into conflict cultures that held very different views of the land and how it might be used and lived on. The painting The First Train, by Herbert Schuyler, depicts three Indians pointing past their encampment at a train in the far distance. The railroad also brought an increasing number of European Americans west. One consequence of this influx was the depletion of the buffalo herds, a major food source for Plains Indians. European Americans would often shoot buffalo for sport from the train; by 1880, the buffalo were mostly gone and Plains Indians had been gathered onto reservations. Millions of acres of open grassland were being settled by the people moving west. Eventually, much of this land became the farmland that fed a growing nation. The transcontinental railroad opened up the West to the rest of the country, even if they never made the trip themselves. A Currier & Ives hand-colored lithograph depicts a train running along the Truckee River in Northern California. The San Francisco publishing firm of Lawrence & Houseworth hired photographers and published photographic tourist catalogs containing views of the West, which they sold commercially. The railroad took hold in popular culture, as shown by sheet music for the song ""New Express Galop [sic]."" There was even a railroad board game illustrating ""Railroads Between New York and San Francisco, California, with Scenes on the Way.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heat flow is determined by the geotherm in the area which is often assumed to be linear, another way of describing that is conductive. Of course because the mountains are actively uplifting, then the heat flow has an advective component that must be taken into account that causes the geotherm to be non-linear (banana shaped). Students construct a simple one stock model that calculates the conductive heat flow out of an uplifting parcel of rock and graph the temperature vs. depth for vairous uplift rates and parcel sizes.(Note: this resource was added to OER Commons as part of a batch upload of over 2,200 records.

She searched the morgues so that she could do a story on the victims. ‘‘I did not wait to count the coffins. It was too harrowing,” she reports. She did watch the hated police being thrown off roofs and also ran the gantlet of the mutinous Kronstadt sailors, who she recalls “all looked like cutthroats.” Allied officers at her hotel smashed the contents of its cellars till they were “literally knee deep in everything from champagne to vodka” to prevent the mob from getting at them.

Other,Sailor,"This extract from Ovid's 'Theban History' recounts the confrontation of Pentheus, king of Thebes, with his divine cousin, Bacchus, the god of wine. Notwithstanding the warnings of the seer Tiresias and the cautionary tale of a character Acoetes (perhaps Bacchus in disguise), who tells of how the god once transformed a group of blasphemous sailors into dolphins, Pentheus refuses to acknowledge the divinity of Bacchus or allow his worship at Thebes. Enraged, yet curious to witness the orgiastic rites of the nascent cult, Pentheus conceals himself in a grove on Mt. Cithaeron near the locus of the ceremonies. But in the course of the rites he is spotted by the female participants who rush upon him in a delusional frenzy, his mother and sisters in the vanguard, and tear him limb from limb.The episode abounds in themes of abiding interest, not least the clash between the authoritarian personality of Pentheus, who embodies 'law and order', masculine prowess, and the martial ethos of his city, and Bacchus, a somewhat effeminate god of orgiastic excess, who revels in the delusional and the deceptive, the transgression of boundaries, and the blurring of gender distinctions.This course book offers a wide-ranging introduction, the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and an extensive commentary. Designed to stretch and stimulate readers, Gildenhard and Zissos's incisive commentary will be of particular interest to students of Latin at AS and undergraduate level.

Many in the United States wanted to go to war against Spain because of these atrocities, and others wanted to use it as an excuse to expand America’s territory.

Other,Haunted,"This set of lessons looks at a variety of natural disasters from the Black Death of the Middle Ages to Hurricane Katrina in our too-recent memory, to fears of avian flu pandemics that haunt the future through the lens of economic analysis. The contexts were chosen to facilitate the teaching of economic reasoning principles not only in economics courses, but also in history and the other social studies disciplines. Each lesson addresses a question that reflects people's compassionate reaction to news of disaster and develops one or two key tools of economic analysis in answering that question. Case studies of past disasters provide real-world illustrations. Mandated content standards and testing have kicked 'current events' days from the social studies classroom calendar, transforming disasters from 'teachable moments' to curricular inconvenience. Using the economic way of thinking to sift through the chaos of natural disasters, however, reveals threads of uniformity running through the litany of horrors and devastation unique to each event. Once identified, the common features of past disasters form a template for analyzing 'the next one,' allowing teachers to quickly incorporate today's unexpected news into the planned curriculum outline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is issued under a creative commons license and can be used for free in whole or in part for non-commercial purposes. The first chapter sets out the general context of global corruption: its nature and extent, and some views on its historical, social, economic and political dimensions. Each subsequent chapter sets out international standards and requirements in respect to combating corruption – mainly in the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the OECD Bribery of Foreign Officials Convention (OECD Convention). The laws of the United States and United Kingdom are then set out as examples of how those Convention standards and requirements are met in two influential jurisdictions. Finally, the law of Canada is set out. Thus, a professor from Africa, Australia, New Zealand or English speaking countries in Asia and Europe has a nearly complete coursebook – for example, that professor can delete the Canadian sections of this book and insert the law and practices of his or her home country in their place.

Other,corruption,"The emperor Nero is etched into the Western imagination as one of ancient Rome’s most infamous villains, and Tacitus’ Annals have played a central role in shaping the mainstream historiographical understanding of this flamboyant autocrat.This section of the text plunges us straight into the moral cesspool that Rome had apparently become in the later years of Nero’s reign, chronicling the emperor’s fledgling stage career including his plans for a grand tour of Greece; his participation in a city-wide orgy climaxing in his publicly consummated ‘marriage’ to his toy boy Pythagoras; the great fire of AD 64, during which large parts of central Rome went up in flames; and the rising of Nero’s ‘grotesque’ new palace, the so-called ‘Golden House’, from the ashes of the city. This building project stoked the rumours that the emperor himself was behind the conflagration, and Tacitus goes on to present us with Nero’s gruesome efforts to quell these mutterings by scapegoating and executing members of an unpopular new cult then starting to spread through the Roman empire: Christianity.All this contrasts starkly with four chapters focusing on one of Nero’s most principled opponents, the Stoic senator Thrasea Paetus, an audacious figure of moral fibre, who courageously refuses to bend to the forces of imperial corruption and hypocrisy.This course book offers a portion of the original Latin text, study aids with vocabulary, and a commentary.

ManyBabies aims to address this problem by forming large-scale collaborations on key theoretical questions in developmental science, while promoting the uptake of Open Science practices. Here, we look back on the first project completed under the ManyBabies umbrella – ManyBabies 1 – which tested the development of infant-directed speech preference. Our goal is to share the lessons learned over the course of the project and to articulate our vision for the role of large-scale collaborations in the field. First, we consider the decisions made in scaling up experimental research for a collaboration involving 100+ researchers and 70+ labs. Next, we discuss successes and challenges over the course of the project, including: protocol design and implementation, data analysis, organizational structures and collaborative workflows, securing funding, and encouraging broad participation in the project. Finally, we discuss the benefits we see both in ongoing ManyBabies projects and in future large-scale collaborations in general, with a particular eye towards developing best practices and increasing growth and diversity in infancy research and psychological science in general. Throughout the paper, we include first-hand narrative experiences, in order to illustrate the perspectives of researchers playing different roles within the project. While this project focused on the unique challenges of infant research, many of the insights we gained can be applied to large-scale collaborations across the broader field of psychology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no family history of any brain lesions, neurological symptoms or other contributory diseases. CT scan showed a radiolucent defect in the left cerebellar hemisphere with a possible mural nodule. In ensuing months, worsening symptoms were experienced with a corresponding increase in lesion size on re-imaging. Four months later, a left posterior fossa craniotomy was performed and revealed a single cystic lesion containing copious amounts of straw- colored fluid and a single mural nodule in the inferior portion of the cyst. Following resection, he was followed clinically until 1985 at which time follow-up was discontinued.

One year later, she presented with worsening headache, nausea, vertigo, photophobia, and episodes of unresponsiveness. CT and MRI revealed a 4 cm mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere with effacement and displacement of the fourth ventricle. A VP shunt was placed semi-emergently, and two days later she underwent a second craniotomy for tumor resection. The diagnosis of hemangioblastoma was once again confirmed. In 2004, follow-up MRI of the brain and spine revealed multiple brainstem and cervical and thoracic cord lesions consistent with hemangioblastomas. An abdominal scan showed cystic kidneys with bilateral enhancing heterogeneous renal masses, suspicious for malignancy, as well as multiple pancreatic cysts and a paraaortic nodule of possible left adrenal origin; however a bone scan was normal. It is unclear whether or not the patient was treated for the presumed renal cell carcinoma at this time.

Neurological examination revealed periodic alternating nystagmus, gait ataxia and bilaterally brisk tendon reflexes in upper and lower extremities and a right extensor plantar reflex. On admission brain MRI there were several lesions with increased T2/FLAIR (Fig. 1BCD) and low T1 signal including a space-occupying lesion in the left half of the pons, extending into the left middle cerebellar peduncle, the medulla and the lower mesencephalic tectum (Fig.1A). Lesions did not exhibit gadolinium enhancement (Fig.1A) but showed restricted diffusion in diffusion-weighted sequences (Fig.1E). Spinal cord MRI was normal. CSF analysis on admission and two months later showed normal cell counts and glucose levels, increased protein (83mg/dL and 90mg/dL, respectively), normal IgG index and no oligoclonal bands. CSF flow cytometric analysis was within normal values and CSF cytology was negative for neoplastic cells in both occasions. Full blood counts, biochemistry, serum LDH, thyroid studies, coagulation profiles, ESR, CRP, autoimmune antibody screening including anti-AQP IV antibodies, plasma folate and B12 vitamin levels, plasma protein immunoelectrophoresis, complement levels, urine analysis and serology for hepatitis and HIV were normal. Bone marrow biopsy and contrast-enhanced whole body CT, upper and lower endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography were unremarkable. Fundoscopy and slit-lamp examination were also unremarkable. Upon magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings suggestive of tumefactive demyelinating lesions, the patient was treated with two monthly courses of mitoxantrone with no apparent clinical benefit and expansion of lesions on MRI, yet still without gadolinium enhancement. A month after the second course of mitoxantrone she developed dysphagia, voice hoarseness and cachexia. Neurological examination revealed left abducens palsy, pathological left-sided cerebellar tests in addition to previous findings and posterior laryngoscopy showed left vocal cord paresis. A new CSF analysis revealed a raised protein level (130mg/dL) with normal cell counts and glucose. CSF cytology, oligoclonal bands were negative and flow cytometric analysis was within normal ranges. A new brain MRI indicated enlargement of pre-existing lesions with peripheral gadolinium enhancement of the brainstem space-occupying lesion (Fig.1F). Stereotactic biopsy of the brainstem lesion was performed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Skiing,"Throughout the early twentieth century, women looked to break new ground in ways never before possible, and the sky literally became the limit. As the nation moved into the aviation age, many women saw flying as a way to break out of traditional societal roles. It gave women not just an opportunity for adventure and excitement, but a way to earn a living outside of the home that demanded respect. Aviatrix Ruth Bancroft Law described it, after defeating the cross-country distance record: ""There is an indescribable feeling which one experiences in flying; it comes with no other form of sport or navigation. It takes courage and daring; one must be self-possessed, for there are moments when one's wits are tested to the full. Yet there is an exhilaration that compensates for all one's efforts."" In this exhibition we explore the early history of aviation and the courageous women who took to the skiesaviatrixes who found freedom, broke new ground, and inspired generations of women along the way.

Other,Skiing,"Three years before the United States entered World War II, President Roosevelt declared the South to be ""the nation's number one economic problem."" Georgia's economy was distinctly agricultural and low-wage, with little manufacturing compared with states in the North and Midwest. The median family income was nearly half of the national average. One year later, an influx of federal defense money established new industries, such as the Bell Aircraft plant in Marietta, and expanded existing ones, such as the J. A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick. While 320,000 Georgians served in the United States Armed Forces, tens of thousands of Georgians repaired aircraft, built B-29 bombers, and worked in shipyards at home during the war. Meanwhile, military training was widespread throughout Georgia, occupying its fields as well as skies. Capitalizing on the state's flat coastal region and mild winters, Army airfields were installed in Savannah, Statesboro, Thomasville, and Waycross, and pilots trained in Albany, Augusta, Americus, and Douglas. Thousands of soldiers passed through Fort Benning and Fort Oglethorpe, where members of the Women's Army Corps trained for positions at home and abroad. World War II employment was crucial to the economic development of the state, ushering in the transformation to a modern, industrial, and diverse Georgia.

Once popular and now little-known, they can tell us a lot about what their first audiences enjoyed, aspired to and worried about - from immigrants in early modern London to the role of women in the household, from what religious changes might mean for attitudes to the dead to fantasies of easy money and social elevation. Each lecture outlines the play so there is no assumption you have already read it, then goes on to try to understand its historical context and its dramatic legacy, drawing parallels with modern film and contemporary culture as well as with Elizabethan material. The lecturer's aim with students in the room and with interested listeners on iTunes U is to broaden our understanding of the theatre Shakespeare wrote for by thinking about some non-Shakespearean drama, and to recreate some of the excitement and dramatic possibilities of the new, popular technology of Renaissance theatre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many scientific issues find their way into the popular press limelight and become blown out of proportion or are even presented in such a way that the articles are factually inaccurate. This activity involves critical reading of popular press articles and a little research to focus on the facts of the straight-up science. A few articles and research prompts of choice have been selected as examples.(Note: this resource was added to OER Commons as part of a batch upload of over 2,200 records.

These worksheets can provide some added structure for whole-class discussion, or can provide a specific agenda for review of the readings in small groups.  Because these readings are more than a few years old, I have also found it useful to assign small groups of students to give brief reports that expand on and update the issues raised in the readings.(Note: this resource was added to OER Commons as part of a batch upload of over 2,200 records.

Other,Random,"This model-eliciting activity has students create rules to allow them to judge whether or not the shuffle feature on a particular iPod appears to produce randomly generated playlists. Because people's intuitions about random events and randomly generated data are often incorrect or misleading, this activity initially focuses students' attention on describing characteristics of 25 playlists that were randomly generated. Students then use these characteristics to come up with rules for judging whether a playlist does NOT appear to be randomly generated. Students test and revise their rules (model) using five additional playlsits. Then, they apply their model to three particular playlists that have been submitted to Apple by an unhappy iPod owner who claims the shuffle feature on his iPod is not generating random playlists. In the final part of the activity, students write a letter to the ipod owner, on behalf of Apple, explaining the use of their model and their final conclusion about whether these three suspicious playlists appear to have been randomly generated.This lesson provides an introduction to the fundamental ideas of randomness, random sequences and random samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other,Random,"An important consideration when sampling from a population is that of random error (also known as sampling error), which results from chance variation in the members of any sample taken from a larger population. Random error may affect the conclusions you draw from a study by affecting the precision of a descriptive study, or the power of an analytic study. However, although the magnitude of random error can be quantified to some degree, its direction cannot be predicted due to its random nature. Random errors can be accounted for to some degree through the application of inferential statistics when presenting and interpreting results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They grapple with what could be a complex problem by brainstorming ideas, presenting the best idea for a solution and analyzing all presented solutions, and then are introduced to an elegant solution. Rather than elaborately calculating the most efficient route and keeping track of which tiles the robot has visited, a random number generator determines which direction the robot will take when it hits a barrier.

Other,Games,"Game Over Gopher is an exciting tower defense game that guides students in plotting coordinate pairs, differentiating negative coordinates from positive coordinates, and identifying the four quadrants. Hungry space gophers are marching towards a prize carrot, and to defend it players place tools around the coordinate grid to “feed” gophers and make them lose interest. Ruby mines (which must be placed at designated x, y coordinates) yield currency that players spend to strategically place carrot launchers, garlic rays, corn silos, and beet traps – gopher feeding tools.  To introduce students to the coordinate grid, Game Over Gopher introduces new skills via interactive tutorials and uses consistent visual clues (e.g., x red, y blue) to guide players in plotting coordinates. This means it’s not necessary to teach students coordinate plotting ahead of time. As the levels progress, the number of tools available increases, the level of math vocabulary increases, the scale of the grid changes, and players are asked to expand their mastery of the grid by reflecting points across axes. The game lowers intimidation about the coordinate grid, helps students understand how positive and negative numbers reflect each other across the axes, and helps students get comfortable with the four quadrants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The students then work collaboratively, in pairs or small groups, to answer a few rudimentary questions that require first-order interpretation of the data to get them comfortable with how the data are presented, and to demonstrate how different indices produce different rankings of relative similarity for the five faunas. For many of the students, it is their first encounter with quantitatively derived, but clearly ambiguous results  --  and the struggle begins (""but which one is right?"") The exercise then tests them with more complex questions that require (without specific announcement) that they devise multiple explanations for low indices (dissimilar faunas) between Sonomia and the Boreal Craton, and critically evaluate those possible explanations. When they are led to the correct conclusion, that a simplistic interpretation of the dissimilarity as a product of geographic separation conflicts with the well established timing of Sonomia's arrival in the Triassic (based on other geologic evidence), it impresses upon them the importance of considering all the data available. In this case, the data falsify the hypothesis that Sonomia was still far away from North America, and require a different explanation for the faunal contrast, such as a latitudinal separation and/or physical separation by some barrier (perhaps highlands created by the Sonoman Orogeny).  The second phase of the exercise involves analysis of a pronounced contrast reported by Loch (2007) in the taxonomic composition of Lower Ordovician trilobite faunas in what is now eastern and western North America, quantified by the Jaccard Index. With the geologic context leaving no doubt that both faunas inhabited the same paleocontinent, the stage is set for discussion of a strong (again, perhaps paleolatitudinal) contrast in environment/lithofacies that produced the contrast. The questions posed in this part of the exercise challenge the students to recognize the strong influence of relative sample sizes (a pitfall of that index), a different taxonomic level (trilobite species, as compared to ammonite genera), and perhaps other factors such as stratigraphic imprecision and inaccuracy in taxonomic assignment in producing values very different from those in the first case study.(Note: this resource was added to OER Commons as part of a batch upload of over 2,200 records.

Other,flame,"NanomaterialsIntroductionWhat are nanomaterials?Nanomaterials have unanimously settled on a precise definition given by Scientists. They are partially characterized by their small size in nanometers.  One millionth of a millimeter approximately 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair is called nanometer.From a variety of products nano-sized particles exist in nature and can be created, for instance, carbon or minerals like silver, but nanomaterials by definition must have at least one dimension less than approximately 100 nanometers. Most of the nanoscale materials are too small to be seen with the naked eye and even with conventional lab microscopes.Upon converting the nanomaterials as engineered materials from a variety of products they have shown unique optical, magnetic, electrical, and other properties. These emergent properties have the potential for great impacts in electronics, medicine, and other fields. For example,1.      Nanotechnology is being used to design target oriented pharmaceuticals to target organs or cells in the body such as cancer cells, and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.2.      In cement, cloth and other materials to make them stronger and yet lighter the nanomaterials are being used.3.      Because of their small size they are extremely useful in electronics, and they can also be used in environmental remediation or clean-up to bind with and neutralize toxins. Engineered nanomaterials on the other hand have provided great benefits on human health and the environment. Even well-known materials, such as silver for example, may pose a hazard when engineered to nano size.Fibrous nanomaterials made of carbon have been shown to induce inflammation in the lungs in ways that are similar to asbestos. Nano-sized particles can enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion and through the skin. Where are nanomaterials found?Nature has produced some nanomaterials, such as blood borne proteins essential for life and lipids found in the blood and body fat.  Scientists, however, are particularly interested in engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are designed for use in many commercial materials, devices and structures.  Already, thousands of common products-- including sunscreens, cosmetics, sporting goods, stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics—are manufactured using ENMs. They are also in medical diagnosis, imaging and drug delivery and in environmental remediation.Synthesis of nanomaterialsMainly there are two types:1.      Top-Down Approach. Another way to think about this is “making big stuff smaller.”  2.      Bottom-Up Approach.  Another way to think about this is “making small stuff bigger.” Top-Down ApproachBy the top-down approach the nanodiamond  is made.  Nanodiamond is nearly pure carbon.  Nanodiamond is made by detonation (explosion) or ultrasonication (using sound waves to break up materials) of bulk graphite flakes: This method of synthesis converts millimeter-size flakes of graphite into nanoscale diamond particles.  The process costs some energy and does not sound very controllable, but if all goes well, you will get nanodiamond particles that are about 5 nanometers in diameter.   Bob Hamers’ group is working on ways to chemically modify nanodiamond particles so they will be stable in water for our biological experiments.Bottom-Up ApproachBy a bottom-up approach, the gold nanoparticles are made.  It uses water-soluble form of gold, known as a gold salt, HAuCl4.  This gold salt produces H+ and AuCl4– ions when dissolved in water.  Later add a chemical compound called a reducing agent, which converts the gold ions into elemental gold atoms. These gold atoms are not as soluble in water, and so clump together into nano-sized particles. I have illustrated this below, and I am just showing 4 gold compounds to illustrate the chemistry: The problem here is that as those gold atoms form nano-sized lumps of gold, they have a tendency to continue to grow into bigger, non-nano-sized lumps.  If we are not careful, we just form big flakes of gold: Structure of nanomaterialsNanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 to 1000 nanometres (10−9 meter) but usually is 1 to 100 nm.Types of NanomaterialsFor the purpose of this article, most current nanomaterials could be organized into four types:•        Carbon Based Materials•        Metal Based Materials•        Dendrimers•        CompositesCarbon Based MaterialsThese nanomaterials are composed mostly of carbon, most commonly taking the form of a hollow spheres, ellipsoids, or tubes. Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics.Metal Based MaterialsThese nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties.DendrimersThese nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery.CompositesComposites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties.Unique PropertiesThe unique properties of these various types of intentionally produced nanomaterials give them novel electrical, catalytic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, or imaging features that are highly desirable for applications in commercial, medical, military, and environmental sectors. These materials may also find their way into more complex nanostructures and systems. As new uses for materials with these special properties are identified, the number of products containing such nanomaterials and their possible applications continues to grow.Types of NanomaterialsThere are mainly two types of nanomaterials. They areFullerenesNanoparticles·         FullerenesFullerenes are actually grapheme sheets rolled in the form of spheres and are actually a class of allotropes of carbon. A main example of fullerene is carbon nanotubes. They are known for their mechanical strength and their good electrical conductivity. Take a look at the fullerene structure given below. Fullerene StructureImage SourceFullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All these are possible only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their high resistance and superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial agents.Fullerenes are obtained by inserting a large amount of current in between two very close graphite electrodes in an atmosphere that is inert in nature.From the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained in between the electrodes, which then forms as a residue. This residue is then converted to obtain fullerenes.·         NanoparticlesNanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors, and other particles that have great chemical, physical, electrical and magnetic properties. Nanoparticles find its main application as chemical catalysts.Nanoparticles have a size so small, that they actually lie between the bulk materials and the molecular structures.  As a result they possess some of the properties of the bulk materials as well as molecular structures.To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of copper nanoparticles. If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At the same time, copper nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also, when the size decreases, they are known to be very hard.·         Sol-gelSol-gels are also considered as nanomaterials for some applications. It finds its main application in some fields like material science and ceramic engineering. The actual process for producing sol-gel is called Chemical Solution Deposition. Such a wet-chemical process is used mainly for the fabrication of metal oxide. Te process starts with a chemical solution, which acts like a precursor. The most common precursors used are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides. These precursors undergo severe reactions to produce a network called “elastic solid”. Such an elastic solid will be a complex system which includes amorphous submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid.Characteristics of NanomaterialsThe main characteristics of nanomaterials like size and shape were observed during the early 1900’s. The main study was done by Zsigmondy, who made detailed studies of nanomaterials that were lesser than 10 nanometers in size. As most of these particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light, an ultramicroscope was used for seeing them.Different types of techniques are employed to characterize the nanoparticles. The most different assessment is in finding the size characteristics. Most of the nanoparticles that are expected to be in the nanometre range actually aggregated in solutions. Even light scattering method, ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy, and so on are used to determine the size and also for knowing the concentrated nano-dispersions.Other characteristics of nanoparticles like surface charge and zeta potential is also found out using certain methods. All these characteristics have to be found out so as to determine the stabilizing point of the material, aggregation prevention point and so on. Some of the common methods that are used to find the characteristics are colloid vibration current method , microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering and so on.Safety regulations of NanomaterialsOne of the main reasons for developing nanomaterials is to save the health of people by the advanced treatment methods the material can provide. The material is good enough in providing advanced targeted methods in delivering drugs. They are also advantageous in detecting diseases in the early stage of its formation. They can also be used for cancer therapy. But apart from all these advantages, they are also known to produce side effects.A different type of approach must be made to test and know the effects of nanomaterials on human body and also on the environment. As the behaviour of nanomaterials is very different from any other small-sized particle The OECD Chemicals Committee has formed a Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials who are to study the different effects of the material and bring about the different safety regulations.One of the main effects of nanomaterials is the increased rate of absorption. When the nanomaterials are manufactured, the ratio of their surface area to volume increases, and causes the rate of absorption to go up through the human skin, lungs and even the digestive track. The main point is that the particles must be absorbed in very small quantities so as to avoid health hazard.The safety regulations do not only concern the people who are applied with, but also the workers who provide it. In order to provide safety, the Swedish Karolinska Institute, conducted different experiments by adding different nanoparticles like iron oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide and titanium dioxide into human lung epithelial cells. Out of these iron oxide nanoparticles were found to produce a little DNA damage and were non-toxic. Zinc oxide was known to be more toxic and copper oxide is known to be the most toxic material.CARBON NANO TUBES (CNT) Technology OverviewThe discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in 1991 opened up a new era in materials science. These incredible structures have an array of fascinating electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. CNT are at least 100 times stronger than steel, but only one-sixth as heavy, so nanotube fibers could strengthen almost any material. Nanotubes can conduct heat and electricity far better than copper. CNT are already being used in polymers to control or enhance conductivity and are added to anti-static packaging.A carbon nanotube is a tube-shaped material, made of carbon, having a diameter measuring on the nanometer scale. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, or about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. CNT are unique because the bonding between the atoms is very strong and the tubes can have extreme aspect ratios. A carbon nanotube can be as thin as a few nanometers yet be as long as hundreds of microns. To put this into perspective, if your hair had the same aspect ratio, a single strand would be over 40 meters long.Carbon nanotubes have many structures, differing in length, thickness, and number of layers. The characteristics of nanotubes can be different depending on how the graphene sheet has rolled up to form the tube causing it to act either metallic or as a semiconductor. The graphite layer that makes up the nanotube looks like rolled-up chicken wire with a continuous unbroken hexagonal mesh and carbon molecules at the apexes of the hexagons.Schematic of carbon nanotube made from rolled graphene sheetThere are many different types of carbon nanotubes, but they are normally categorized as either single-walled (SWNT) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT). A single-walled carbon nanotube is just like a regular straw. It has only one layer, or wall. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are a collection of nested tubes of continuously increasing diameters. They can range from one outer and one inner tube (a double-walled nanotube) to as many as 100 tubes (walls) or more. Each tube is held at a certain distance from either of its neighboring tubes by interatomic forces.Single vs multi-walled CNTCurrently, the most popular use for carbon nanotubes is in structural reinforcement. The high strength and low weight of CNT combined with their flexibility allow for them to be added to other materials like rebar to concrete. Advances are being made using carbon nanotubes to extract power from sunlight and even as a heat source. Carbon nanotubes are unique in that they are thermally conductive along their length but not across the tube itself. This lets carbon nanotubes play a role on both sides of thermal insulation. CNT are also highly electrically conductive, which could potentially make for an extremely cost effective replacement for metal wires. The semiconducting properties of CNT make them candidates for the next generation of computer chips. Other applications under investigation are their use as chemical carriers for pharmaceutical applications. Specific drugs can be attached to CNT that can target and attack only certain types of cells, including cancer cells, for example.It is important to note that growth of carbon nanotubes in general always requires the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst is usually predeposited on the surface on which growth will take place. The catalyst can also be suspended in a hot gas stream and nanotube formation will occur that way as well, though the latter is a very inefficient way to do so. It also should be mentioned that it is possible to inject both a hydrocarbon compound and a catalyst-bearing compound simultaneously into a CVD system and get growth without prepatterning the substrate. An example would be injecting toluene and ferrocene simultaneously, in which case the growth is characterized as a two-source process and would require two injection mechanisms operating simultaneously as well as a carrier gas injection assembly. The single source precursor that comes with the SSP354 is much simpler, less expensive and more reliable to use.Reference: Internet sources   NanomaterialsIntroductionWhat are nanomaterials?Nanomaterials have unanimously settled on a precise definition given by Scientists.

When the nanomaterials are manufactured, the ratio of their surface area to volume increases, and causes the rate of absorption to go up through the human skin, lungs and even the digestive track. The main point is that the particles must be absorbed in very small quantities so as to avoid health hazard.The safety regulations do not only concern the people who are applied with, but also the workers who provide it. In order to provide safety, the Swedish Karolinska Institute, conducted different experiments by adding different nanoparticles like iron oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide and titanium dioxide into human lung epithelial cells. Out of these iron oxide nanoparticles were found to produce a little DNA damage and were non-toxic. Zinc oxide was known to be more toxic and copper oxide is known to be the most toxic material.CARBON NANO TUBES (CNT) Technology OverviewThe discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in 1991 opened up a new era in materials science. These incredible structures have an array of fascinating electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. CNT are at least 100 times stronger than steel, but only one-sixth as heavy, so nanotube fibers could strengthen almost any material. Nanotubes can conduct heat and electricity far better than copper. CNT are already being used in polymers to control or enhance conductivity and are added to anti-static packaging.A carbon nanotube is a tube-shaped material, made of carbon, having a diameter measuring on the nanometer scale. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, or about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair. CNT are unique because the bonding between the atoms is very strong and the tubes can have extreme aspect ratios. A carbon nanotube can be as thin as a few nanometers yet be as long as hundreds of microns. To put this into perspective, if your hair had the same aspect ratio, a single strand would be over 40 meters long.Carbon nanotubes have many structures, differing in length, thickness, and number of layers. The characteristics of nanotubes can be different depending on how the graphene sheet has rolled up to form the tube causing it to act either metallic or as a semiconductor. The graphite layer that makes up the nanotube looks like rolled-up chicken wire with a continuous unbroken hexagonal mesh and carbon molecules at the apexes of the hexagons.Schematic of carbon nanotube made from rolled graphene sheetThere are many different types of carbon nanotubes, but they are normally categorized as either single-walled (SWNT) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT). A single-walled carbon nanotube is just like a regular straw. It has only one layer, or wall. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes are a collection of nested tubes of continuously increasing diameters. They can range from one outer and one inner tube (a double-walled nanotube) to as many as 100 tubes (walls) or more. Each tube is held at a certain distance from either of its neighboring tubes by interatomic forces.Single vs multi-walled CNTCurrently, the most popular use for carbon nanotubes is in structural reinforcement. The high strength and low weight of CNT combined with their flexibility allow for them to be added to other materials like rebar to concrete. Advances are being made using carbon nanotubes to extract power from sunlight and even as a heat source. Carbon nanotubes are unique in that they are thermally conductive along their length but not across the tube itself. This lets carbon nanotubes play a role on both sides of thermal insulation. CNT are also highly electrically conductive, which could potentially make for an extremely cost effective replacement for metal wires. The semiconducting properties of CNT make them candidates for the next generation of computer chips. Other applications under investigation are their use as chemical carriers for pharmaceutical applications. Specific drugs can be attached to CNT that can target and attack only certain types of cells, including cancer cells, for example.It is important to note that growth of carbon nanotubes in general always requires the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst is usually predeposited on the surface on which growth will take place. The catalyst can also be suspended in a hot gas stream and nanotube formation will occur that way as well, though the latter is a very inefficient way to do so.

Other,flame,"IntroductionWhat are nanomaterials?Nanomaterials have unanimously settled on a precise definition given by Scientists. They are partially characterized by their small size in nanometers.  One millionth of a millimeter approximately 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair is called nanometer.From a variety of products nano-sized particles exist in nature and can be created, for instance, carbon or minerals like silver, but nanomaterials by definition must have at least one dimension less than approximately 100 nanometers. Most of the nanoscale materials are too small to be seen with the naked eye and even with conventional lab microscopes.Upon converting the nanomaterials as engineered materials from a variety of products they have shown unique optical, magnetic, electrical, and other properties. These emergent properties have the potential for great impacts in electronics, medicine, and other fields. For example,1.      Nanotechnology is being used to design target oriented pharmaceuticals to target organs or cells in the body such as cancer cells, and enhance the effectiveness of therapy.2.      In cement, cloth and other materials to make them stronger and yet lighter the nanomaterials are being used.3.      Because of their small size they are extremely useful in electronics, and they can also be used in environmental remediation or clean-up to bind with and neutralize toxins. Engineered nanomaterials on the other hand have provided great benefits on human health and the environment. Even well-known materials, such as silver for example, may pose a hazard when engineered to nano size.Fibrous nanomaterials made of carbon have been shown to induce inflammation in the lungs in ways that are similar to asbestos. Nano-sized particles can enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion and through the skin. Where are nanomaterials found?Nature has produced some nanomaterials, such as blood borne proteins essential for life and lipids found in the blood and body fat.  Scientists, however, are particularly interested in engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), which are designed for use in many commercial materials, devices and structures.  Already, thousands of common products-- including sunscreens, cosmetics, sporting goods, stain-resistant clothing, tires, and electronics—are manufactured using ENMs. They are also in medical diagnosis, imaging and drug delivery and in environmental remediation.Synthesis of nanomaterialsMainly there are two types:1.      Top-Down Approach. Another way to think about this is “making big stuff smaller.”  2.      Bottom-Up Approach.  Another way to think about this is “making small stuff bigger.” Top-Down ApproachBy the top-down approach the nanodiamond  is made.  Nanodiamond is nearly pure carbon.  Nanodiamond is made by detonation (explosion) or ultrasonication (using sound waves to break up materials) of bulk graphite flakes: This method of synthesis converts millimeter-size flakes of graphite into nanoscale diamond particles.  The process costs some energy and does not sound very controllable, but if all goes well, you will get nanodiamond particles that are about 5 nanometers in diameter.   Bob Hamers’ group is working on ways to chemically modify nanodiamond particles so they will be stable in water for our biological experiments.Bottom-Up ApproachBy a bottom-up approach, the gold nanoparticles are made.  It uses water-soluble form of gold, known as a gold salt, HAuCl4.  This gold salt produces H+ and AuCl4– ions when dissolved in water.  Later add a chemical compound called a reducing agent, which converts the gold ions into elemental gold atoms. These gold atoms are not as soluble in water, and so clump together into nano-sized particles. I have illustrated this below, and I am just showing 4 gold compounds to illustrate the chemistry: The problem here is that as those gold atoms form nano-sized lumps of gold, they have a tendency to continue to grow into bigger, non-nano-sized lumps.  If we are not careful, we just form big flakes of gold: Structure of nanomaterialsNanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 to 1000 nanometres (10−9 meter) but usually is 1 to 100 nm.Types of NanomaterialsFor the purpose of this article, most current nanomaterials could be organized into four types:•        Carbon Based Materials•        Metal Based Materials•        Dendrimers•        CompositesCarbon Based MaterialsThese nanomaterials are composed mostly of carbon, most commonly taking the form of a hollow spheres, ellipsoids, or tubes. Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics.Metal Based MaterialsThese nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties.DendrimersThese nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery.CompositesComposites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties.Unique PropertiesThe unique properties of these various types of intentionally produced nanomaterials give them novel electrical, catalytic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, or imaging features that are highly desirable for applications in commercial, medical, military, and environmental sectors. These materials may also find their way into more complex nanostructures and systems. As new uses for materials with these special properties are identified, the number of products containing such nanomaterials and their possible applications continues to grow.Types of NanomaterialsThere are mainly two types of nanomaterials. They areFullerenesNanoparticles·         FullerenesFullerenes are actually grapheme sheets rolled in the form of spheres and are actually a class of allotropes of carbon. A main example of fullerene is carbon nanotubes. They are known for their mechanical strength and their good electrical conductivity. Take a look at the fullerene structure given below. Fullerene StructureImage SourceFullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All these are possible only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their high resistance and superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial agents.Fullerenes are obtained by inserting a large amount of current in between two very close graphite electrodes in an atmosphere that is inert in nature.From the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained in between the electrodes, which then forms as a residue. This residue is then converted to obtain fullerenes.·         NanoparticlesNanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors, and other particles that have great chemical, physical, electrical and magnetic properties. Nanoparticles find its main application as chemical catalysts.Nanoparticles have a size so small, that they actually lie between the bulk materials and the molecular structures.  As a result they possess some of the properties of the bulk materials as well as molecular structures.To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of copper nanoparticles. If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At the same time, copper nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also, when the size decreases, they are known to be very hard.·         Sol-gelSol-gels are also considered as nanomaterials for some applications. It finds its main application in some fields like material science and ceramic engineering. The actual process for producing sol-gel is called Chemical Solution Deposition. Such a wet-chemical process is used mainly for the fabrication of metal oxide. Te process starts with a chemical solution, which acts like a precursor. The most common precursors used are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides. These precursors undergo severe reactions to produce a network called “elastic solid”. Such an elastic solid will be a complex system which includes amorphous submicrometer particles dispersed to various degrees in a host fluid.Characteristics of NanomaterialsThe main characteristics of nanomaterials like size and shape were observed during the early 1900’s. The main study was done by Zsigmondy, who made detailed studies of nanomaterials that were lesser than 10 nanometers in size. As most of these particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light, an ultramicroscope was used for seeing them.Different types of techniques are employed to characterize the nanoparticles. The most different assessment is in finding the size characteristics. Most of the nanoparticles that are expected to be in the nanometre range actually aggregated in solutions. Even light scattering method, ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy, and so on are used to determine the size and also for knowing the concentrated nano-dispersions.Other characteristics of nanoparticles like surface charge and zeta potential is also found out using certain methods. All these characteristics have to be found out so as to determine the stabilizing point of the material, aggregation prevention point and so on. Some of the common methods that are used to find the characteristics are colloid vibration current method , microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering and so on.Safety regulations of NanomaterialsOne of the main reasons for developing nanomaterials is to save the health of people by the advanced treatment methods the material can provide. The material is good enough in providing advanced targeted methods in delivering drugs. They are also advantageous in detecting diseases in the early stage of its formation. They can also be used for cancer therapy. But apart from all these advantages, they are also known to produce side effects.A different type of approach must be made to test and know the effects of nanomaterials on human body and also on the environment. As the behaviour of nanomaterials is very different from any other small-sized particle The OECD Chemicals Committee has formed a Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials who are to study the different effects of the material and bring about the different safety regulations.One of the main effects of nanomaterials is the increased rate of absorption. When the nanomaterials are manufactured, the ratio of their surface area to volume increases, and causes the rate of absorption to go up through the human skin, lungs and even the digestive track. The main point is that the particles must be absorbed in very small quantities so as to avoid health hazard.The safety regulations do not only concern the people who are applied with, but also the workers who provide it. In order to provide safety, the Swedish Karolinska Institute, conducted different experiments by adding different nanoparticles like iron oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide and titanium dioxide into human lung epithelial cells. Out of these iron oxide nanoparticles were found to produce a little DNA damage and were non-toxic. Zinc oxide was known to be more toxic and copper oxide is known to be the most toxic material.CARBON NANO TUBES (CNT) Technology OverviewThe discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in 1991 opened up a new era in materials science.

The catalyst can also be suspended in a hot gas stream and nanotube formation will occur that way as well, though the latter is a very inefficient way to do so. It also should be mentioned that it is possible to inject both a hydrocarbon compound and a catalyst-bearing compound simultaneously into a CVD system and get growth without prepatterning the substrate. An example would be injecting toluene and ferrocene simultaneously, in which case the growth is characterized as a two-source process and would require two injection mechanisms operating simultaneously as well as a carrier gas injection assembly.

Other,factory,"In animal experiments, animals, husbandry and test procedures are traditionally standardized to maximize test sensitivity and minimize animal use, assuming that this will also guarantee reproducibility. However, by reducing within-experiment variation, standardization may limit inference to the specific experimental conditions. Indeed, we have recently shown in mice that standardization may generate spurious results in behavioral tests, accounting for poor reproducibility, and that this can be avoided by population heterogenization through systematic variation of experimental conditions. Here, we examined whether a simple form of heterogenization effectively improves reproducibility of test results in a multi-laboratory situation. Each of six laboratories independently ordered 64 female mice of two inbred strains (C57BL/6NCrl, DBA/2NCrl) and examined them for strain differences in five commonly used behavioral tests under two different experimental designs. In the standardized design, experimental conditions were standardized as much as possible in each laboratory, while they were systematically varied with respect to the animals' test age and cage enrichment in the heterogenized design. Although heterogenization tended to improve reproducibility by increasing within-experiment variation relative to between-experiment variation, the effect was too weak to account for the large variation between laboratories. However, our findings confirm the potential of systematic heterogenization for improving reproducibility of animal experiments and highlight the need for effective and practicable heterogenization strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Melody,"Music Theory for the 21st–Century Classroom is an openly–licensed online four–semester college music theory textbook. This text differs from other music theory textbooks by focusing less on four–part (SATB) voiceleading and more on relating harmony to the phrase. Also, in traditional music theory textbooks, there is little emphasis on motivic analysis and analysis of melodic units smaller than the phrase. In my opinion, this led to students having difficulty with creating melodies, since the training they are given is typically to write a “melody” in quarter notes in the soprano voice of part writing exercises. When the assignments in those texts ask students to do more than this, the majority of the students struggle to create a melody with continuity and with appropriate placement of harmonies within a phrase because the text had not prepared them to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Unit 2, students will continue reading The Lightning Thief (more independently): in class, they will focus on the novel’s many allusions to classic myths; those allusions will serve as an entry point into a deeper study of Greek mythology. They also will continue to build their informational reading skills through the close reading of texts about the close reading of texts about the elements of myths. This will create a conceptual framework to support students’ reading of mythology. As a whole class, students will closely read several complex Greek myths.

It examines the reciprocal, interactive relationship between politics and economics or between states and markets in the contemporary international system by exploring how political factors influence international economic relations and how the international economy in turn shapes domestic and international politics.The module introduces the main theoretical approaches in international political economy and global development and illustrates the contributions of these approaches to our understanding of the global political economy.The module surveys the interactions between state and societal actors at the interface between the domestic and international domains in a variety of issue areas. These include international trade and monetary relations, transnational production, economic development, and global governance. In studying these issues, the module examines the causes and effects of policy choices that states and societal groups make to regulate international economic relations, of international and regional co-operation and conflicts over trade, monetary, development and other policies, and of global market integration.This module is designed in such a manner that it will provide second-year politics students with an accessible introduction to the basic concepts of political economy and global development and sensitise them to interdisciplinary methods and models in the study of international relations. The module not only provides a comprehensive introduction to international political economy and global development but also serves a foundation course that qualifies students to take further options in the political economy of international trade, monetary relations, financial markets, development, and globalisation.Module Code: M12089Suitable for study at: Undergraduate level 2Credits:20Dr Xiaoke Zhang, School of Politics and International RelationsDr Xiaoke Zhang is an Associate Professor in political economy and Asian studies in the School of Politics and International Relations, the University of Nottingham.

Other,Economy,"Political Economists are concerned with the allocation of scarce resources in a world of infinite wants and needs. In order to allocate these resources, politics are used within a state to provide for the people. Political economy is the study of the relationships between individuals and society, and more specifically, the relationships between citizens and states.Political economy is a study of philosophy and ideology that studies the evolution of political and economic ideas. Political economy is a mixture of politics, economics, sociology, philosophy, and history, which all bring together evidence to the study of how humans exist within societies. Political economists study political ideology, economic structure, human interaction, human nature, and theories in philosophical thought. It is a study that studies not only the mechanics of a particular structure, but also the reasoning behind why a structure is regarded to be the best by various people with different beliefs.The study of political economics can be split into two different sections, one which is Classical Political Economy and the other which is Modern Political Economy. The classical branch studies range from the conservative philosophers such as Machiavelli to liberals such as Adam Smith to the critiquers of liberalism such as Marx. The modern branch studies range from social liberals such as Keynes to modern political economists whose works deal with a multitude of issues including foreign trade and globalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Determination,"What determines our health? Why does life expectancy differ so much from country to country, or even from one group to another in the same country? Well, there is no easy answer to these questions. There are many factors that play a part in determining the well-being of the population, or even of an individual. In global health, we call these factors determinants of health. Determinants of health interact with each other, and influence our health status is in numerous ways, in turn influencing our well-being, morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy. As you already know, the first and most important health determinant is income. Income of an individual or a household, but also income of the country a person lives in. Other important health determinants are education, access to water, diet, environment and many more. In this presentation we will look closer at how health determinants determine an individual’s health, and how different health determinants interact with each other.Get transcript for video here: https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/module/58789/overview",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Confession,"Nat Turner (1800–1831) was known to his local “fellow servants” in Southampton County as “The Prophet.” On the evening of Sunday, August 21, 1831, he met six associates in the woods at Cabin Pond, and about 2:00 a.m. they began to enter local houses and kill the white inhabitants. Over the next 36 hours, they were joined by as many as 60 other slaves and free blacks, and they killed at least 10 men, 14 women, and 31 infants and children. By noon of Tuesday, August 23, the insurgents had been killed, captured, or dispersed by local militia. Nat Turner alone escaped—until October 30, when he was caught in the immediate vicinity, having used several hiding places over the previous 9½ weeks. The next day he was delivered to the county sheriff and lodged in the county jail in Jerusalem (now Courtland), Virginia. There, from November 1 through November 3, he was interviewed by Thomas Ruffin Gray, a 31-year-old lawyer who had previously represented several other defendants charged in the uprising. Gray had witnessed the aftermath of the killings, interviewed other participants, and survivors, and had supplied written accounts to various newspapers. He was familiar with the outlines of Nat Turner’s life and the plot, and he was aware of the intense interest and the commercial possibilities of its originator’s narrative.In the Confessions, Nat Turner appears more a fanatic than a practical liberator. He tells of being spoken to by the Holy Spirit, of seeing visions and signs in the heavens—”that I was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty.” In Gray’s view, “He is a complete fanatic, or plays his part most admirably.”On November 5th, Nat Turner was tried and condemned to be executed; on November 9th, he was hanged. On November 10th, Gray registered his copyright for the Confessions, in Washington, D.C. Within a week his pamphlet appeared, and it is estimated over 50,000 copies were sold in the next few months.This electronic online edition is based on the first edition, published at Baltimore, MD, in November 1831.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other,Confession,"Benjamin Franklin was sixteen years old and working as an apprentice in the Boston print shop of his older brother James when, in April 1722, he began writing a series of essays to be published in the New-England Courant under the pseudonym of “Silence Dogood.” In his Autobiography, Benjamin remembered slipping these essays, written in disguised handwriting, under the door of the Courant, which James was publishing; he assumed (probably correctly) that James would refuse to print an essay from him if he simply asked or submitted it under his own name. James published the essays, which became very popular among the newspaper’s readers. Benjamin kept his authorship of the series a secret, even from his brother, until after he finished writing them in October 1722, at which point James printed an advertisement asking for “Silence Dogood” to come forth.

A link to the final diagnosis can be found at the end of the case study for review. The first paragraph of the case study -- typically, but not always the clinical presentation -- is provided below.)The patient is a 76 year old gentleman with recent (~6 mos prior to admission) left lung transplantation, with a non-cytomegalovirus (CMV)- matched organ, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Following transplantation he was maintained on prednisone, pantoprazole, valganciclovir, voriconazole (for pulmonary ""colonization"" with Aspergillus), tacrolimus, metoprolol, and dapsone. The patient presented to the emergency room on the advice of his pulmonologist after calling the latter with complaints of nausea with a few bouts of ""biliary"" emesis and fevers to 100-101 degrees Farenheit over the previous week. In the emergency room, that patient denied cough, shortness of breath, and tobacco use, and confessed to an increased gag reflex thought to be secondary to medications he was taking with reduced oral intake.

Because of the patient's difficulties in swallowing from gag reflex abnormality, he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage reflecting his known allergies to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and penicillins. Multiple blood cultures and quantitative PCR for CMV were negative over the next 10 days. On day 10 of treatment, the patient had a repeat computed tomography scan of the chest that showed a mild to moderate left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation, with persistent reactive mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient at this point was deemed stable enough for bronchoscopy with biopsy, to rule out possible acute cellular rejection and try to find a cause for fever.

Other,Confession,"Traditions of ""Debate"" in Japan*Narahiko INOUE**Key words: argumentation, speech, debate, dibeeto, discussion, ESS, English Speaking Society, oral communication, rhetoric, speech communication, tooron,1. IntroductionThis study discusses how the English concept of debate and its equivalent in Japanese have been treated in Japan. The analysis here will pay special attention to categories of talk (e.g., Frake 1969), especially debate, dibeeto, and tooron in order to compare and contrast different traditions of debate.A review of literature on rhetorical traditions in the West and in Japan will find that Japanese society lacks a tradition of training in logical argumentation comparable to Western societies probably because Japanese society did not need logical (at least in the Western sense) argumentation in disputes as much as its Western counterparts. Japanese society has experienced several opportunities of introducing Anglo-American debate but they did not succeed except for English debate in students' clubs mostly called ESSs (English Speaking Societies) [1]. There has been a new rise in the popularity of debate in media and education since the mid-1980s together with the use of the loanword dibeeto 'debate,' but it is uncertain at present how much and how persistent the current popularity is.In the following sections, first, I will review the Anglo-American tradition of debate. The focus is on the concept of debate in Speech Communication in America, since it has greatly influenced the introduction of debate in Japan, especially in education and students' clubs. Second, I will discuss a comparable Japanese concept, tooron 'debate' in Japanese culture. Third, I will discuss how that dimension of the concept of debate which is alien to traditional Japanese culture has been introduced in Japan.2. The Meaning of Debate in the Anglo-American Tradition2.1. Definitions of DebateThe English word debate encompasses a range of meaning from a broad meaning of everyday disputes to a restricted meaning of a particular educational training method. Let us look at some definitions from Webster's Third International Dictionary of the English Language:2a. a contention by means of words or arguments: strife in argument ... specif: the formal discussion, argumentation, and resolution of a motion before a legislative assembly or other public deliberative body according to the rules of parliamentary procedure.b. consideration of or reflection upon a problem.3b. (1) a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides as a test of forensic ability.(2) a course of study of the methods and techniques of such discussion often taught in schools and colleges.The first half of the definition 2a above indicates a broad sense of debate, which includes such events as an argument between a husband and a wife about whether they should buy a new washing machine. The second half indicates a debate used in real-world decision-making based on strict rules such as in a courtroom or in a legislative assembly. Thus, debate refers to a process of argument in which the two (or more) opposing parties try to persuade each other or a third party about a controversial issue, whatever it is about, whether it is about shopping or a national policy.Since there is a course called debate in schools and colleges in America, as definition in 3b.(2) suggests, many textbooks have been published. One of them defines debate as ""the process of presenting persuasive information on behalf of or in opposition to a stated proposition or topic"" (Sayer 1980: 11). Another textbook regards debate as a method of decision-making, defining it as ""the process of inquiry and advocacy, the seeking of reasoned judgement on a proposition"" (Freeley 1981: 2). This definition by Freeley reflects the inherited tradition of Western philosophy, especially rhetoric, from the time of Plato and Aristotle. Debate in this sense is a means to inquire into a probable truth of a question about which we cannot find the absolute truth by weighing pros and cons, and then to publicize and defend the discovered truth. A related term argumentation refers to a process and the study of making rational claims in such situations.Debate is often contrasted with discussion in textbooks. The distinction in their use in referring to a decision-making process may be outlined as follows:1. In debate, participants argue for and against the pre-fixed proposition. In discussion, participants look for a solution to a problem.2. Consequently, debate considers two alternatives, while discussion considers multiple alternatives.3. Debate is usually regulated by strict rules about the time and order of speeches. Discussion is conducted more freely with less formal rules.4. In debate, the decision is made by a third party based on the arguments presented by the affirmative and the negative sides. In discussion, the purpose is to reach an agreement among participants.(Thompson 1971: 8)As a final comment on the previous definitions taken from Webster's, definition 2b includes decision making within a person's mind. For example, one can reach a decision through debating in one's mind whether one goes to a movie in the evening or studies at home.2.2. Characteristics of Academic DebateWe have so far described a kind of debate which concerns real-world decision-making. In American textbooks, this is called substantive debate. It should be distinguished from academic debate, which is conducted as educational training. The definition in 3b.(1) refers to academic debate and the one in 3b.(2) is the name of an academic course which teaches debate.Academic debate is primarily for training in skills necessary in substantive debate. In academic debate, participants practice arguing both for and against a proposition regardless of their own beliefs. There are strict rules and the two sides speak for the same amount of time alternately. A third party (usually judges, sometimes the audience) gives the decision and/or critiques of the arguments.Academic debate is offered as one of the speech courses in American colleges and high schools. It is also popular in extracurricular activities (see e.g., Klopf 1978). Debate is also used in British classrooms and is found in extracurricular activities (Gross (1965) has several articles describing school curriculum and activities in which debate is mentioned.).Further survey is needed for determining how wide-spread academic debate is in different countries but this will be left for future research.The general value of academic debate, as Thompson (1971: 1) says, is in the belief that debate is important ""to the political and social processes of a democratic society."" Debate textbooks also give more specific benefits of debate, which I would summarize as follows:1. Intellectual training to cultivate abilities to analyze a problem, to make logical claims, to find fallacies, to understand opinions different from one's own, and to do research (e.g., in a library).2. Communication training to learn effective ways of constructing arguments, of speaking in public, and in critically listening to other people's speech.3. Training in cultivating desirable attitudes such as interests in social problems, fair play, and cooperation.2.3. History of Academic DebateThis section will overview the history of academic debate based on such sources as Freeley (1981), McCroskey (1982), and Potter (1944). The history of academic debate dates back to the Greek sophist Protagoras (481 - 411 B.C.). He thought that almost every proposition had two sides (the affirmative and the negative), which a speaker must be able to advocate. Rhetoric in general, including debate skills, played an important role in education as a necessary qualification for citizens of Greece and Rome.In the Middle Ages, when political freedom of speech was restricted, the importance of debate was lost for ordinary citizens. Disputation (syllogistic disputation in Latin), the ancestor of academic debate, continued to be essential training for scholars in emerging universities and for clergymen in Christian churches. It was important for scholars because the syllogism was considered a means to discovering truth following the Aristotelian tradition. Scholars also needed training in syllogistic disputation to defend their own theory against others. The church recognized the importance of disputation as a means to defend the orthodox theological stance.In the 1400s, one of the first intercollegiate debates in England was held between Oxford and Cambridge Universities. It was, in keeping with collegiate practice of the time, a disputation in Latin (Klopf and Cambra 1979: 3). In the eighteenth century, we saw debating societies where people debated various topics in English in and out of schools. In 1823, the United Debating Society (later called the Oxford Union Society) was established at Oxford University. At first, students debated non-political issues and then political issues as well. The union sent many leaders out into different fields. For example, Prime Ministers Gladstone and Heath were both presidents of the union (Hollis 1965).The British tradition of collegiate debating was brought into American colleges and universities; syllogistic disputation about theological and philosophical issues was a required subject in Harvard and other universities. In the middle of the eighteenth century, forensic disputation in English started, in which students learned debating of political and legal topics.Also in the eighteenth century in the United States, debate was conducted in new-born literary or debating societies, which are both student organizations and community meetings. In November of 1872, one of the first intercollegiate debates was held between Northwestern University and the University of Chicago (Bauer 1978: 153). Around that time, high-school students also started interscholastic debating. In the 1920s, national tournaments were held for college and high-school students. Many of the American leaders have experienced debate training. Among political leaders, President Lincoln practiced debating in the New Salem Club, and such presidents as Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon learned debate at school.3. Traditions of Tooron in JapanIt is often said that Japanese avoid verbal conflict and that tooron 'debate' is not compatible with their traditional communication patterns. For example, Adachi (1984: 27-28) states as follows:... even today quite a few people feel disbelief or even hostility about argument and dispute. In fact, such people seem to be rapidly increasing. Several reasons can be thought of for that attitude. One of them which readily comes to anyone's mind is that speech activities themselves, not to mention disputes, are traditionally not given an important status in people's life in this country, where part of the national ethos is reflected in such ethical sayings and proverbs as ""koogen reishoku sukunashi jin ['A honey tongue, a heart of gall' (originally from Confucius)],"" ""chinmoku wa kin ['silence is golden'],"" ""fugen jikkoo ['actions without words (Actions speak louder than words)'].""(Translation by Inoue)The word tooron has been used as a translation equivalent of debate since around 1880, according to one Japanese dictionary (Koojien; also see Section 3.1. below). The word itself, however, was used before that time, as another dictionary (Nihon kokugo dai jiten) gives examples of its use starting from the early 12th century. One of the examples it gives from a literary anthology is: ""ooku moromoro no hito to tooron-seshi koto o zatsuroku-shitaru mono nari"" ('[the book is] a miscellaneous collection of what many kinds of people debated'). The meaning of tooron in this citation overlaps that of English debate in its broad sense.We can also find a speech event called rongi, similar in some ways to debate. It is ""one of the events in the palace and temples, in which many people listen to one-to-one tooron"" (Hashimoto 1972: 274; translation by Inoue). Hashimoto (1972) also mentions uta rongi, a debate about poems following the style of rongi, referring to a historical narrative (Ookagami) in the eleventh century. Daigenkai (a Japanese dictionary) defines rongi as ""a ritual in which people such as high-ranking priests conducted questions and answers, and a debate about themes in sutras"" (translation by Inoue). It is to be noted here that debate or some kind of dialectical disputation took place in religious and educational institutions in different parts of the world. It appears to have had educational functions for young priests in those groups. It is yet to be studied how similar or dissimilar ways of debating in different groups are.[2]Sawada (1983: 285) discusses taiketsu or taimon, a kind of debate between a plaintiff and a defendant conducted in monchuujo (a legal court in the Kamakura and Muromachi Eras) by referring to Azumakagami (another historical narrative).[3] In contemporary Japanese, taiketsu is used to mean any confrontation both verbal and physical not necessarily in a legal court. Taimon is no longer used. A possibly related word hantaijinmon 'cross-examination' is used in both legal courts and in academic debate; it most likely originated as a translation for the English cross-examination.In this way we see that Japan traditionally has words for debate and other related speech events. However, a number of authors emphasize the difference from the Western (Anglo-American) tradition in that the Japanese ""debate"" tradition is not based on logical (in the Western sense of the term) argumentation. Sawada (1983: 287) explains that ""rhetoric based on logic has not been cultivated because Japan had too much rhetoric based on emotion and ethics"" (translation by Inoue). We did not find any strong societal demand for training in argumentation, at least in the sense of the Western normative view.3.1. History of Introducing Western-Style DebateAlthough there have been a number of attempts to introduce Western-style debate in Japan, the only one which succeeded was in English clubs in colleges (ESSs or English Speaking Societies).First, when Christianity was brought into Japan in the 16th century, schools attached to churches gave training in Latin disputation, which did not spread outside of churches (Cieslik 1965: 18). Even among Japanese Christians, the popularity of disputation is doubtful.In the Meiji Era, Anglo-American oratory and debate were introduced. For example, Yukichi Fukuzawa and his associates organized Mita Enzetsu Kai 'Mita Speech Society' and made efforts to popularize public speaking. At the same time, they wrote Kaigiben ([Conference Speech] or [Speaking in Meetings]), a book that explained how to conduct meetings (Fukuzawa, Obata, & Koizumi c.1874). They took pains in translating terminology in conference proceedings; for example, they translated speech as enzetsu (literally 'performing talk') and debate as tooron (literally 'fighting arguments').[4] Kaigiben listed benronkai ('speech meeting') as one of their activities. Benronkai consisted of practices in jiyuu toogi ('free discussion') and tooron ('debate'). Tooron which they conducted included two kinds of debate: one in which they argued based on their own belief and the other in which they practiced debate with choosing the side by drawing lots.Noji (1980) wrote about speech activities in high schools before World War I. He quotes a description by an alumnus about activities of ""bungaku shakai (riterarii sosaeti 'literary society')"" established in 1877 in Too-oogijuku High School in Hirosaki City in northern Japan, which was modeled after American college literary societies (Noji 1980: 1020-1030). Its activities included a debate with a jury selected from the audience, in which the affirmative and the negative teams alternately delivered their speeches and then the debate became open to the floor. Noji (1980) goes on to trace high-school debating in various parts of Japan in the following years before World War II.[5]It appears that the concept of Anglo-American eloquence became well-known in Japan with the rise of democratic movements in the Meiji Era. The most popular mode of elocution in Japan, however, was one-way oratory. Although unchallenged oratory was popular, debate in which the opponent's arguments were examined and refuted did not become popular in Japan. This may be due to Japanese dispreference for overt confrontation in general and/or due to the tradition in which ""rhetoric based on logic"" (as opposed to emotional appeal) did not develop in Japan (see Section 3 above). The dominance of emotional appeal is also noted in a rhetorical style of high-school students' oratory in the early Showa Era. It is characterized as ""a type [of rhetoric] in which one shouts, appeals, and asserts"" and ""a rhetoric of screaming"" (Noji 1980: 1167; translation by Inoue).In the Showa Era, under the military-influenced government, free exchange of opinions was increasingly discouraged.3.2. After World War II (Asahi Debate Contest)Japan's defeat in World War II and the subsequent occupation by the Allied Forces drastically changed the official norms of speech and press. Debate training in the Japanese language as a basis of democracy attracted attention under the influence of the American educational philosophy. Iwagami (1947: 93) discusses the social role of debate and concludes that ""... what I think most important is the building-up of democratic personality through practicing debates, the development of humanity itself, and the cultivation of democratic personality with strong and uninhibited freedom"" (translation by Inoue). In the same book titled Tooron: Riron to Jissai [Debate: Theory and Practice] (Asahi Shinbunsha 1947) we find other chapters which suggest high expectations concerning debate: ""What is Debate?"" by Goroo Hani, who explains debate based on traditions dating back to ancient Greece; ""Debate as Inquiry into Truth"" by Masamichi Ariyama; ""Debate Tournament in America"" by Shiho Sakanishi; ""About Judging"" by Yasuzoo Suzuki.Toshio Kanchi, who promoted debating in Asahi Shinbunsha (newspaper company), wrote a practical manual of debate based on American concepts of academic debate. We can see that the basis of this textbook was probably an American debate textbook written by Musgrave (1945/1946) because there is some overlap in the contents.The Asahi Debate Contest, an intercollegiate debate contest sponsored by Asahi Shinbunsha, was held from 1946 through 1950. In 1948, there was a record participation of 208 schools (Kanchi 1951). There were other tournaments such as a prefectural youth tournament sponsored by Tochigi Prefectural Board of Education and an annual debate tournament for correctional officers in prisons sponsored by the Ministry of Justice (Kanchi 1951). Most of the records that suggest the popularity of debate are found only in the Asahi Shinbun articles, which may have been biased because of its sponsorship of those contests. But Haga (1976:254) also mentions the debate in the 1948 entry of his chronology of public speaking events as ""More and more students participated in debate competition with the method of 'Asahi Debate Contest'."" (translation by Inoue) Some of my senior colleagues in their sixties remember that they participated in one of those debate contests when they were students.In 1950, Asahi Shinbunsha discontinued its Asahi Debate Contest. The reasons for this were reportedly that various organizations had started to sponsor voluntarily Asahi-style debate contests and that the newspaper company would support them (Asahi Shinbunsha 1950). According to Kanchi (1951: 6-7) the reason why the Asahi Debate Contest was discontinued is that the newspaper company had fulfilled its initial role of promotion since debate had attracted enough popular support that people themselves were ready to hold debates. The company also said that the wide popularity of debate no longer justified a newspaper company sponsoring a tournament only for students. The reasons were not very convincing. Actually, the popularity of debate rapidly died down.[6]A specialist of language education regrets:... It is regrettable that in Japan the Intercollegiate Debate Contest sponsored by the Asahi Shinbun has been suspended, which started with all the efforts after the War. I wish the Asahi would revive the contest. If it is impossible, I wonder if some other newspaper company will sponsor an annual national debate tournament. (I said ""newspaper company"" simply because other organizations are unlikely to afford to sponsor a tournament at the moment; other organizations would be fine.)(Ookubo 1953: 208; translation by Inoue)By 1953, national-level tournaments had already disappeared.3.3. Debate Education in SchoolsIn Japanese-language courses (called kokugo 'national language'), speech instruction including debating did not become very popular. Although the Ministry of Education's Course of Study included speech education, Hamanaka (1955: 276) doubted whether it was seriously implemented in high schools as prescribed.One of the early attempts to introduce debating in elementary and secondary school classrooms, after the decline of the Asahi debate, was promoted by a group of people who belonged to the Nihon Hanashi Kotoba Kyooiku Kenkyuukai [Japan Speech Education Study Group]. Their practices are reported in Shikoo ryoku, gengo nooryoku o takameru tooron shidoo [Debate instruction to improve thinking ability and language ability] (published in 1967 from Meijitosho) and Ronriteki shikoo o takameru hyoogen shidoo [Expression instruction to improve logical thinking] (Kobayashi and Araki 1974). One of the members confesses that, in early 1960s when the teachers in his study group planned teaching debate in elementary and junior-high schools, ""almost nobody in our study group had experienced debating ... 'debate instruction' was like developing a virgin land"" (Hayashi 1974: 212-213; translation by Inoue).The subsequent years have witnessed a number of books and articles being published about the use of debate in classrooms; the number especially increased in the second half of the 1980s (Oda 1978, Koyama 1983, Ishiguro 1988, 1989, 1991, a number of articles in Gendai kyooiku kagaku [Modern education science], which is a monthly journal for teachers about classroom methodologies). Unfortunately the study of debate education has not been systematically developed. Many of those writings are based on the authors' own classroom practices. We can also find an ungrounded claim like ""competitive debate is an essential training in Western schools but it is completely lacking in Japanese education in Japan"" (Kinoshita 1990: 7; translation by Inoue).Kai (1990), in contrast, tries to identify problems in speech education in Japanese schools after World War II. According to his analysis, speech education has long been part of the goals of school education. It was included in Chuugakkoo Gakushuu Shidoo Yooryoo [Junior High School Course of Study] published from the Ministry of Education in 1947 and there has been no extreme change of policy in the Course of Study. Yet, educators have had three different kinds of problems: (1) the failure to identify gijutsu 'skills,' (2) the failure to examine naiyoo 'contents,' and (3) the failure to provide ba 'situations.' The first problem was observed in the Showa 20s (1945-1954), when the Course of Study only had a list of gengo katsudoo 'speech activities' but failed to suggest specific skills to teach. The second problem was observed in the Showa 30s (1955-1964) thereafter, when the skills were identified but educators failed to examine contents (topics to discuss) about which those skills should be used. The third problem started to emerge in the Showa 40s (1965-1974) and influenced the 1977 edition of the Course of Study. Leading scholars in kokugo kyooiku 'national-language education' such as Kenji Morioka questioned speech education in kokugo as a school subject and argued that reading and writing should be the primary concern of kokugo as a school subject.[7] Most of the problems of debate instruction by Wakyooken (Nihon Hanashi Kotoba Kyooiku Kenkyuu Kai above [8] ) were of the second kind in that the teachers in the group were not so much interested in subject matters of debate as in the skills of argumentation such as methods of refutation.There are other causes of the relative neglect of speech education in general, debate in particular, in secondary schools. Although the Course of Study for senior high school has had speech education together with composition under the title of hyoogen 'expression', only a small amount of classroom time has been devoted to essay writing on contemporary topics, much less to public speaking. The reality in schools is that ""speech instruction, which has less direct relation with college entrance examinations, tends to be neglected"" (Oda 1978: 382; translation by Inoue).[9]4. The Use of the Word DibeetoRecently the use of the word dibeeto written in katakana, (a Japanese syllabic writing system used mainly for loanwords) has been increasingly observed. This corresponds to the recent seeming popularity of debate in Japanese in various domains such as schools, business workshops, and media. In the subsequent sections, I will discuss the spreading of debate focusing on the use of the word dibeeto, as opposed to tooron, to refer to 'debate.'Since the mid-1980s, among various speech activities called tooron, a particular kind of debate, which is more or less comparable to American academic debate described above, is called dibeeto and written in katakana. How much dibeeto shares with academic debate as prescribed in American Speech Communication is yet to be investigated. But apparently when dibeeto is used instead of tooron, the speaker or the writer intends to emphasize particular aspects of dibeeto which are not obvious in other speech activities traditionally called tooron. What are traditionally called tooron are often more appropriately called round table discussion or forum than debate in American English. Dibeeto is intended as a rule-governed confrontational activity. It was also called tooron until recently, and still is, in many cases.4.1. Dibeeto in English EducationProbably the earliest extensive use of the word dibeeto would be found among people who practiced debate under the influence of American speech education. Many of these people, including myself, were exposed to debate in a collegiate extracurricular club called ESS (English Speaking Society). Although each debate itself is conducted in English, Japanese is often used in conversation outside debate, and then the word dibeeto is often used. In such a situation, the pronunciation is modified to fit the phonotactics of Japanese as dibeeto, so it is not pronounced English debate. It is safe to conclude that the loanword dibeeto is being used, rather than the English word debate. Dibeeto is overwhelmingly the preferred choice over tooron when people refer to their activity (or particular speech event, i.e., debate match/round).0In writing, the usage of tooron, dibeeto, and debate is mixed. Intercollegiate English debate contests, which began in 1950 for universities in the Kanto area and spread nation-wide in the 1960s, used tooron in their official Japanese titles. Manuals written by students use dibeeto or debate when texts are written in Japanese.[10] In publications, tooron used to be common. For example, Koike (1966) used tooron when he discussed English debating in high schools in Tokyo. Textbooks written by Mannebach and Uematsu (1973) and Klopf and Kawashima (1977) used tooron in the titles of their books (the text was written in English). However, one issue of a magazine featuring debate used dibeeto in most of the cases in which the concept or event of debate is referred to (the English Journal, February 1977). Textbooks written by Konno (1979) and S. Matsumoto (1987) used dibeeto in their titles.Recently, the word dibeeto has increasingly attracted the attention of people concerned with English education in school settings because of the use of the word in the Ministry of Education's Course of Study for senior high schools, which was published in 1989 and came into effect in 1993. This Course of Study has a new subject (course) called ""Oral Communication C"" whose contents are described as follows:(1) Care should be taken so that instructions are given in the use of expressions about proposing, advocating, and proving.(2) In instructing language activities, scenes should be set up such as recitation, speech, discussion, and debate, and efforts should be made to deal with various topics.(Kotoogakkoo Gakushuu Shidooyooryoo ""Gaikokugo"" [Senior High School Course of Study ""Foreign Languages""], Chapter 2, Section 5.3; translation by Inoue)In the original Japanese text, the underlined words in the above passage are written in katakana as reshiteeshon, supiichi, disukasshon, and dibeeto. The inclusion of such a passage in the Course of Study has caused considerable anxiety among teachers who are not familiar with these speech activities. They worry about what to do with debate in classrooms. Consequently there have been a number of articles introducing the basics of debate in books and periodicals for teachers of English. There are also workshops and lectures about debate sponsored by governmental and private organizations aiming at high-school English teachers.4.2. The Use of Dibeeto in Mass MediaIn the previous section about English education, I have already mentioned several published writings which used dibeeto. In this section, I will discuss the word's use in media in general, especially in the written media of popular newspapers and magazines.Except for use in the publications influenced by American scholars of speech communication and those related to ESSs, the use of dibeeto in the Japanese language is a recent phenomenon. The use of tooron has been much more common even if the referent is ""debate"" in the sense of competitive presentation of opposing arguments.One of the earliest uses of dibeeto in the title of a book is found in M. Matsumoto's Chiteki taiketsu no ronri: nihonjin ni dibeeto ga dekiru ka [Logic of intellectual confrontation: can Japanese people debate?] published in 1975.[11] He has been a strong advocate of debate especially in training for business negotiation. He has conducted workshops and published a number of books and articles primarily for business people.The inclusion of dibeeto into Japanese dictionaries is also recent. One of the prominent dictionaries for new words listed the word for the first time in 1980 (Gendai yoogo no kiso chishiki [Encyclopedic dictionary of current terms]). At first the entry in this dictionary only had translation equivalents: ""Tooron. Toogi.""[12] Since 1984, a definition has been given as:Tooron. Toogi. A contest in which competing two teams debate (tooron-suru) on the affirmative side and on the negative side according to stipulated rules.Koojien (a leading unabridged Japanese dictionary) listed the word dibeeto for the first time in its newest edition (1991) with the following definition:Tooron in which speakers are randomly divided into the affirmative side and the negative side, give constructive speeches (ritsuron), cross-examinations (jinmon), and rebuttals (hanbaku) about a certain theme, and judges decide the win and loss.Another unabridged dictionary also gives a definition of dibeeto to the same effect:Tooron. Especially a format in which debaters (tooron-sha) compete for skills in persuading the opponent and/or the audience under certain rules, with the affirmative and the negative sides of the theme being assigned regardless of their personal thought or belief.""(Nihongo Dai Jiten 1989 (Koodansha); translation by Inoue)The dictionary definitions above emphasize a certain aspect of original English debate, i.e., academic debate (debate as educational practice and/or contest). This is precisely the area of meaning that distinguishes dibeeto from tooron. The newspaper articles that use dibeeto in the 1990s in fact refer to this kind of academic debate conducted in the Japanese language. Table 1 shows the frequency of articles that include dibeeto in their texts. Some of them refer to debate in Western countries or to debate as an idea, while most of them refer to debates that are taking place in Japan, such as contests, public demonstrations, and debates in schools and business workshops.Table 1.

Other," 'on-paper debate')"""" give the pros and cons of an issue (as in articles often carried by AERA", DIME," an interview with Michihiro Matsumoto is titled """"the pioneer of debate"""" (The Asahi Shinbun", May 22, 1990).12 Toogi is less frequently used than tooron. Some authors of books on communication skills contrast toogi 'discussion' with tooron 'debate' but the contrast is not commonly observed in ordinary usage of Japanese.13 The search was conducted by the author using the text database of the three newspapers available in G-Search in NIFTY-Serve, which is a commercial on-line database. NA indicates that the articles in those years are not included in the database.14 In the Japanese title of the contest, the word dibeeto was used rather than the Japanese counterpart tooron.15 I do not have enough evidence to infer how the organizer decided the style of the contest. I only note here characteristics of three of the key figures who contributed to the organization of the contest. When the contest began, the commercial-base planning was done by Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency. Michihiro Matsumoto was giving technical advice on debate. Later, he was replaced with Shigeru Matsumoto (no relative of Michihiro), who inherits American academic debate more directly. Michihiro Matsumoto, in contrast, is advocating his adopted view of debate. He calls it dibeeto doo (literally 'debate way'). Doo in this sense may be translated as 'principle' or 'doctrine.'16 The author is currently serving as the chairman of the Japan Debate Association.17 In 1993 I saw occasional programs called Nyuu Eiji Dibeeto 'New Age Debate' on the NHK General Channel. The format was about the same as that used in Seishun Tooku Tooku.18 In writing tooron," the program often uses an alternative Chinese character for too. This alternative character (dou in Chinese) gives a stronger sense of physical fight than the original character (tao in Chinese). This tooron program is characterized by the dominance of """"having arguments"""" rather than """"making arguments"""" (cf. O'Keefe (1977) about the distinction between the two types of argument).19 However"," I should also note that the same issue of the magazine has a column called """"Hot Talk: FAX tsukatte shijoo dibeeto [Debate on paper using FAX]"," in which readers' opinions are contrasted about the theme of the month: """"Do you want to quit the company and change job? Or do you want to stay in the same company?""""20 For example", one debate program mentioned earlier (Dibeeto from Fuji TV) is not broadcast in Fukuoka.21 Although I did not ask her if she had known the word dibeeto, my impression was that she had known it because she did not ask back when I mentioned dibeeto. It must be the case that the first word she had in mind when she heard --beeto was ribeeto not dibeeto. But it is also possible that she had not known the word dibeeto. It is very difficult to infer the knowledge of a speaker from an incidental event.22 Early in 1995, debate attracted an unexpected attention of popular media and the general public because the chief spokesman of a murderous cult religious group in Japan demonstrated his skills in argumentation in press conferences and other public occasions. He was a successful debater in an ESS when he was a student. The effect of this popular attention to debate in terms of the popularization of the word and concept of debate is yet to be studied.REFERENCESAdachi, Yukio. 1984.

Other,Aviation,"By the end of WWII, Pan American World Airways’ infamous fleet of flying boats became rapidly obsolete as the aviation industry transitioned to landplanes and as more runways were built. Increasing demand for air travel led to continual aeronautical innovations, many of which were established or introduced by Pan Am. Their constant modernization not only transformed commercial aviation, but impacted the world socially, politically, and economically, thereby changing world culture forever. Whereas in its early days, the company had focused on connecting the world through new air routes, their primary goal in later years would be to carry even more people and do it bigger, better, and faster than ever before. Truly, Pan Am helped “shrink the world.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aviation maintence technicians are qualified to perform service or make repairs on all types and sizes of private and commercial aircraft, including airplanes, helicopters, and their propulsion systems.Contents include student project books for FAA general, airframe, and powerplant programs, course objectives, course outlines, and other instructional materials for eight airframe courses and eight general courses, and an instructor project book. A glossary of aircraft mechanic terms was also developed to assist English language learners and students new to aviation. Materials were developed to implement on computers and tablets maintained in the aviation labs.EASA (European Aviation Safety Administration) is the European equivalent of the FAA, and also certify aircraft mechanics to repair or service European aircraft. Although the skill sets of the two certifications are similar, the processes for attaining and certifying the skills is very different. A crosswalk between FAA and EASA certification was completed and curriculum for short modules to fill identified gaps between FAA curriculum and EASA standards were developed by subject matter experts. These gaps include fiberoptics, human factors, and EASA regulations. Supplemental information outlines the self-improvement route that aircraft mechanics may take toward earning EASA certification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
